# Next Word Prediction

## Author: Catherine Muthoni

### Project Description
This project involves using Recurrent Neural Networks(Long Short Term Memory Networks(LSTMs) in particular) to predict the next word in a sequence of 5 words.

The dataset used to train the model was a novel titled "The Top Five Regrets Of the Dying". 

The project also includes a web application built using Python(Streamlit) that includes a text box that takes in a 5 word sentence as input and predicts the next word as output.
