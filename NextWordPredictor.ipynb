              "\"\\nOn a balmy summer’s evening in a little country town, a conversation was\\nunderway that was like many cheerful conversations taking place simultaneously\\nall over the world. It was two people simply catching up with each other and\\nhaving a yarn. The difference with this conversation though, was that it could be\\nlater identified as one of the most significant turning points of a person’s life.\\nAnd that person was me.\\n\\nCec is the editor of a great folk music magazine in Australia, called Trad and\\nNow. He is equally known and loved for his support of folk music in Australia,\\nas he is for his big cheerful smile. We were chatting about our love of music\\n(which was very appropriate, since we were at a folk music festival). The\\nconversation also touched on the challenges I was currently facing, to find\\nfunding for a guitar and songwriting program that I wanted to start in a women’s\\njail. “If you get it up and running, let me know and we’|l print a story,” Cec said\\nwith encouragement.\\n\\nI did in fact get it up and running and some time afterwards, I wrote a story for\\nthe magazine about my experiences. When I finished writing, I questioned\\nmyself as to why I wasn’t writing more stories in my life. After all, I had always\\nwritten. As a freckle-faced little girl, I wrote to pen friends all over the world.\\nThis was in the days when people still wrote letters by hand that went into\\nenvelopes and mailboxes.\\n\\nWriting didn’t stop at adulthood either. Handwritten letters to friends\\ncontinued, as did years of journals. And I was now a songwriter. So I was still\\nwriting, as such (just with a guitar, as well as a pen in my hands). But the\\nenjoyment I experienced in writing the story about the jail, which I did at the\\nkitchen table with an old-fashioned pen and paper, reignited my love of writing.\\nSo I sent thanks to Cec and soon after, I decided to start writing a blog. The\\nevents that followed changed my life’s direction in the very best of ways.\\n\\n‘Inspiration and Chai’ began in a snug little cottage in the Blue Mountains of\\nAustralia, naturally enough, over a cup of Chai tea. One of the first articles I\\nwrote was about the regrets of dying people who I had cared for. The role of a\\ncarer had been my most recent occupation before the jail job, so it was still fresh\\nin my life. Over the following months, the article gained momentum in ways that\\nonly the Internet can explain. I began receiving emails from people I didn’t\\nknow, connecting with me on the article and then on other articles I’d written\\nsince.\\n\\nAlmost a year later, I was living in a different little cottage, this one in a\\nfarming district. One Monday morning as I sat at the table on the verandah to\\nwrite, I decided to check the stats on my website, as one does from time to time.\\nA puzzled but amused look crossed my face. The next day I returned for another\\nlook, and the next. Sure enough, something big was happening. The article, also\\ncalled ‘The Top Five Regrets of the Dying’ had found its wings.\\n\\nEmails began pouring in from all over the world, including requests from\\nother writers to quote the article on their blogs and for it to be translated into\\nnumerous languages. People read it on trains in Sweden, at bus stations in\\nAmerica, in offices in India, over breakfast in Ireland, and on and on it went. Not\\neveryone actually agreed with the article, but it prompted enough discussion to\\ncontinue its ride around the world. As I said to the few who didn’t agree, if I did\\nreply, ‘Don’t shoot the messenger’. I was simply sharing what dying people had\\nshared with me. At least ninety five per cent of the feedback that came in from\\nthe article though, was beautiful. It also reinforced just how much we all have in\\ncommon, despite cultural differences.\\n\\nAll the while this was happening, I was living in the cottage, enjoying the bliss\\nof the birds and other wildlife that the creek out the front drew in. I sat at the\\ntable on my verandah each day and kept working, saying “Yes” to opportunities\\nthat began presenting themselves. In the months that followed, over one million\\npeople read ‘The Top Five Regrets of the Dying’. Within a year, that number had\\nmore than trebled.\\n\\nIt was due to the enormous amount of people who connected to this theme,\\nand at the requests of many people who contacted me afterwards, that I decided\\nto elaborate on the subject. It had always been my intention to write a full-length\\nbook one day, as many other people also wish to do. As it turned out though, it\\nwas only through telling my own story here that I could fully articulate the\\nlessons that were given to me, while caring for dying people. The book I had\\nwanted to write was ready to be written. It is now this book.\\n\\nAs you will read from my story, I’ve never been one to follow any traditional\\nways in life, if such a thing truly exists. I live as I am guided and write this book\\nsimply as a woman who has a story to share. Also, I am Australian, and as much\\nas I have written as universally as possible, Australian spelling and language is\\nused.\\n\\x0cAlmost all of the names in the book have been altered to protect the privacy of\\nthe families and friends. My first yoga teacher, my boss at the pre-natal centre,\\nthe caravan park owner, my mentor with the jail system, and any songwriters\\nmentioned, are all original names however. The chronological order has been\\nshifted slightly too, in order to share common themes between clients.\\n\\nMy thanks go to all who have assisted my journey in so many different ways.\\nFor support and/or positive influence professionally, special thanks go to: Marie\\nBurrows, Elizabeth Cham, Valda Low, Rob Conway, Reesa Ryan, Barbara\\nGilder, Dad, Pablo Acosta, Bruce Reid, Joan Dennis, Siegfried Kunze, Jill Marr,\\nGuy Kachel, Michael Bloeme, Ana Goncalvez, Kate and Col Baker, Ingrid Cliff,\\nMark Patterson, Jane Dargaville, Jo Wallace, Bernadette, and all who support my\\nwriting and music by connecting with it in a positive way.\\n\\nThank you also to the many people who helped to keep a roof over my head at\\nvarious times, including: Mark Avellino, Auntie Jo, Sue Greig, Helen Atkins,\\nUncle Fred, Di and Greg Burns, Dusty Cuttell, Mardi McElvenny, and all of my\\nwonderful house-sitting clients whose homes I have loved as my own. Thank\\nyou also to every kind person who has ever fed me.\\n\\nFor personal support along the winding road, I thank all friends past and\\npresent, near and far. Thank you for enriching my life in so many ways. Special\\nthanks to: Mark Neven, Sharon Rochford, Julie Skerrett, Mel Giallongo,\\nAngeline Rattansey, Kateea McFarlane, Brad Antoniou, Angie Bidwell, Theresa\\nClancy, Barbra Squire, all who serve at the meditation centre in the mountains\\nthat led me to a road of peace, and my partner. You have all been my stretcher\\nwhen I’ve most needed to rest.\\n\\nThanks of course to my mother Joy, the most appropriately named person to\\never walk the Earth. What a sacred lesson in love you have given to me, by\\nnatural example. Endless thanks, beautiful woman.\\n\\nTo all of the wonderful people who have now passed on, whose stories not\\nonly make up this book, but have also influenced my life significantly; this book\\nis a tribute to you. I also thank the families left behind, for the loving,\\nmemorable times we experienced together. Thank you all.\\n\\nLastly, thank you to the magpie singing in the tree by the creek as I write this.\\nYou and all of your fellow birds have kept me delightful company whilst writing\\nthese pages. Thank you God for sustaining me, and for sending so much beauty\\nmy way.\\n\\nSometimes we don’t know until much later that a particular moment in time\\nhas changed our life’s direction. So many of the moments shared in this book\\nchanged my life. Thank you Cec for reigniting the writer within me. And thank\\nyou, the reader, for the goodness of who you are and for our connection.\\n\\nWith loving kindness,\\nBronnie.\\n\\nThe Verandah at Sunset\\nTuesday Afternoon.\\nFROM THE TROPICS TO THE SNOW.\\neter\\n\\n“T can’t find my teeth. I can’t find my teeth.” The familiar call flowed into the\\nroom as I attempted to have my scheduled afternoon off. Placing the book I was\\nreading on the bed, I wandered out into the living area.\\n\\nAs expected, Agnes was standing there looking both confused and innocent,\\nsmiling her gummy grin. We both burst out laughing. The joke should have wom\\nthin by now as the misplacement of her teeth happened at least every few days.\\nBut it never did.\\n\\n“T am sure you do this just to get me back out here with you,” I laughed as I\\nbegan today’s search in now familiar places. Outside snow continued to fall,\\nenhancing the cosiness and warmth of the cottage. Shaking her head, Agnes was\\nadamant. “Not at all Darling! I took them out before my nap but when I awoke, I\\ncouldn’t find them anywhere.” Other than her memory loss, she was as bright as\\na button.\\n\\nAgnes and I came to be living together four months earlier when I had\\nresponded to an advertisement for a live-in companion. As an Australian in\\nEngland, I had been doing a live-in job in a pub to keep a roof over my head. It\\nhad been fun and some lovely friendships were made with other staff and the\\nlocals. Bar skills were definitely handy and had enabled me to start work\\nimmediately on my arrival in the country. So for that, I was grateful. But it came\\ntime for a change.\\n\\nThe two years prior to going overseas were spent living on a tropical island, as\\npicturesque as any postcard could ever portray. After more than a decade of\\nworking in the banking industry, I had needed to try an existence that released\\nme from the Monday to Friday, nine to five grind.\\n\\nOne of my sisters and I ventured to an island in North Queensland for a\\nholiday, to gain our scuba diving certificates. While she cracked onto our diving\\ninstructor, which was of course very beneficial for us in passing our tests, I\\nclimbed a mountain on the island. While sitting on an enormous boulder in the\\nsky, smiling, I had an epiphany. I wanted to live on an island.\\n\\nFour weeks later, the bank job was no more, and my belongings were either\\nsold or sent to a shed on my parent’s farm. Two islands were chosen from a map\\n\\x0csimply for their geographic suitability. I knew nothing else about these islands,\\nother than I liked their location and there was a resort on each of them. This was\\nbefore the Internet where you could find out anything about everything in a\\nflash. With application letters in the mail, I headed north, destination unknown.\\nIt was 1991, also before mobile phones arrived en masse in Australia a few years\\nlater.\\n\\nAlong the way, my carefree spirit was given a timely and cautious warning, as\\na hitch hiking experience saw me retiring from that occupation very quickly.\\nFinding myself on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere, way off track from the\\nrequested town, rang enough warning bells for me to never put my thumb out\\nagain. He said he wanted to show me where he lived, as houses faded away and\\nbushland thickened, the dirt road showing few signs of regular visitors.\\nThankfully I stayed strong and determined, managing to talk myself out of the\\nsituation. Only a few slobbery kisses were attempted from him as I finally exited\\nthe car, rather quickly, in the right town. So that was the end of my hitch hiking.\\n\\nI stuck to public transport then and other than that dodgy experience, it was a\\ngreat adventure, particularly not knowing where I would end up living next.\\nTravelling on various buses and trains ensured my path also crossed with some\\ngreat people while I was being transported to warmer climates. A few weeks into\\nthe trip, I called my mum who had received a letter telling me there was a job\\nwaiting on one of the chosen islands. Being so desperate to escape the banking\\ngrind, I had made the ridiculous mistake of saying I was willing to take any job,\\nand a few days later was living on a beautiful island, up to my elbows in filthy\\npots and pans.\\n\\nIsland life was a fantastic experience though, not only releasing me from the\\nMonday to Friday grind, but also effectively releasing me from even knowing\\nwhat day of the week it was. I loved it. After a year of being what was not so\\naffectionately known as a dish-pig, I worked my way into the bar. The time in\\nthe kitchen had actually been a lot of fun and taught me a wealth of things about\\ncreative cookery. But it was hot, hard, and sweaty work in a non-air conditioned\\nkitchen in the tropics. Days off at least were spent wandering magnificent\\nrainforests, hiring boats and cruising to nearby islands, scuba diving, or just\\nkicking back in paradise.\\n\\nVolunteering in the bar eventually opened the door for me into this coveted\\nrole. Overlooking a million dollar view of perfect calm blue waters, white sands,\\npalm trees swaying, the whole thing, it was not a hard job. Dealing with happy\\ncustomers who were having the holidays of their lives, and becoming adept at\\n\\x0cmixing cocktails worthy of travel brochure photos, was a world away from the\\nprevious life I knew in banking.\\n\\nIt was over the bar I met a man from Europe who offered me a job at his\\nprinting company. Travel yearnings had always been a part of me and after more\\nthan two years of island life by then, I was starting to crave some change and to\\nenjoy being somewhat anonymous again. When you live and work within the\\nsame community day in day out, privacy in your everyday living can start to\\nbecome sacred.\\n\\nCulture shock was to be expected for anyone returning to mainland life after a\\ncouple of years on an island. But to throw myself from that into a foreign\\ncountry where I couldn’t even speak the language was challenging to say the\\nleast. Some nice people crossed my path during these months and I am glad to\\nhave experienced the time. But I needed some like-minded friends again, so\\neventually headed off to England. Arriving there with only enough money for a\\ntravel card to get to the one person I knew in the country, and with one pound\\nsixty six left over, a new chapter began.\\n\\nNev had a lovely big smile and head of thinning white curls. He was also a\\nwine-loving expert, appropriately working in the wine department at Harrods. It\\nwas the first day of the store’s summer sale and coming straight off the overnight\\nferry across the channel, I certainly looked like the waif I was wandering into\\nthis classy, busy joint. “Hi Nev. I’m Bronnie. We met once. I’m a friend of\\nFiona’s. You crashed out on my beanbag a few years ago,” I announced to him\\nover the counter with a cheerful grin.\\n\\n“Of course Bronnie,” I was relieved to hear. “What’s happening?”\\n\\n“T need a place to stay for a few nights please,” I said rather hopefully.\\n\\nReaching into his pocket for his key, Nev replied “Sure. Here you go”. And\\nwith that I had a roof over my head, sleeping on his sofa, and directions to his\\nplace.\\n\\n“May I also borrow ten quid please?” I asked optimistically. Without\\nhesitation, ten quid came out of his back pocket. Offering words of thanks and a\\ncheerful smile in reply, I was sorted. I had a bed and food.\\n\\nThe travel magazine I had intended to find a job from came out that morming,\\nso I picked up a copy, went home to Nev’s and made three phone calls. By the\\nnext morming I was being interviewed for a live-in pub job in Surrey. By that\\nafternoon I was living there. Perfect.\\n\\nLife rolled on for a couple of years with friendships and romance. They were\\nfun times. Village life suited me, reminding me of the island community at times\\n\\x0cand I was surrounded by people I had come to love. We were also not terribly far\\nout of London so regular trips happened easily, most of which I thoroughly\\nenjoyed.\\n\\nBut further travel was calling. I wanted to check out a bit of the Middle East.\\nThe long English winters were good experiences and I was glad to have done a\\ncouple of them. It was a complete contrast to the long, hot summers of Australia.\\nBut I had a choice to stay or go, and decided to stay for one more winter, with\\ndetermination to save some money for the trip. To do this I needed to remove\\nmyself from the pub scene and the temptation to be out socialising every night. I\\nwas never much of a drinker anyway and have since become a non-drinker, but\\nbeing out and about every night still cost money that could take me travelling\\ninstead.\\n\\nAlmost as soon as I’d made that decision, the job advertisement for the role\\nwith Agnes caught my eye, as it was only in the next county to Surrey. The\\nposition was offered to me at my first interview, when the farmer Bill realised I\\nwas a farm girl myself. His mother Agnes was in her late eighties, had shoulder\\nlength grey hair, a cheerful voice, and a huge round stomach, covered almost\\nevery day by the same red and grey cardigan. Their farm was only about half an\\nhour’s drive away, so seeing everyone on days off was easy enough. But it felt\\nlike a different world while I was there. It was very isolating, as I was with\\nAgnes around the clock from Sunday evening until Friday evening. Two hours\\noff every afternoon didn’t allow much time for socialising, though I did use that\\ntime occasionally to see my English man.\\n\\nDean was a darling person. It was humour that linked us from the very start,\\nwithin the first minute of meeting. Our love of music also bonded us. We had\\nmet the day after I arrived in the country, just after the interview for the pub job,\\nand it soon became obvious that both of our lives were richer and funnier by\\nknowing each other. Unfortunately though, it wasn’t Dean’s company I was most\\nkeeping by then. I was usually snowed in with Agnes and more often than not,\\nbusy looking for her teeth. It was amazing how one could find so many different\\nlocations within such a small home, to lose your teeth in.\\n\\nHer dog Princess was a ten-year-old German Shepherd who moulted hair\\neverywhere. She was a sweet natured dog but was losing strength in her hind\\nlegs from arthritis. It was a common condition in this breed of dog apparently.\\nLearning from past experience, I lifted up her rump and looked underneath for\\nher lady’s teeth. No luck today. On another occasion though, she had sat on\\nthem. So it was always worth the look. Princess wagged her big tail then\\n\\x0creturned to her dreams by the fire, forgetting the brief disturbance in a second.\\nTime and again, Agnes and I crossed each other’s path as we continued the\\nsearch. “They’re not here,” she would call from the bedroom.\\n\\n“They’re not here either,” I’d reply from the kitchen. Eventually though, I\\nwould find myself searching the bedroom and Agnes, the kitchen. There are only\\nsO many rooms to search in a little home, so we covered them all to be doubly\\nsure. On this particular day they had slipped into her knitting bag, beside the\\nlounge chair.\\n\\n“Oh you are a treasure Darling,” she said, putting them back in her mouth.\\n“Come and watch television with me now that you’re out here.” This was a\\nstrategy that was often used and I smiled as I went along with her request. She\\nwas an old lady who had lived alone a long time and was enjoying the company.\\nMy book could wait. It was hardly like the job was strenuous at the best of times.\\nIt was simply companionship and if she needed that outside of my scheduled\\nwork-hours, no worries.\\n\\nThe teeth had previously been found under her cushion, back in the bathroom\\nvanity, in a teacup in the kitchen cupboard, in her handbag, and numerous other\\nhalf-believable places. But they had also turned up behind the television, in the\\nfireplace, in the rubbish bin, on top of the fridge, and in her shoe. And of course,\\nunder Princess, the mighty German Shepherd’s backside.\\n\\nRoutine works for a lot of people. Personally, I thrive on change. But routine\\nhas its place and it certainly works best for many people, particularly as they are\\ngetting older. There were weekly routines and daily routines with Agnes. Every\\nMonday we went to the doctors, as Agnes had to have regular blood tests. The\\nappointment was at the exact same time every week. One thing per day was\\nenough though, or it would ruin her afternoon routine of rest and knitting.\\n\\nPrincess came everywhere with us, rain, hail or shine. The tailgate of the pick-\\nup would be lowered first. The old dog would wait patiently, always wagging her\\ntail. She was a gorgeous creature. I would then lift her front paws onto the\\ntailgate and quickly grab her rear and lift her up fully, before the rear legs gave\\nway and we had to start over again. I would then be covered in sandy coloured\\ndog hair for the remainder of the outing.\\n\\nHopping down was easier, though she still required assistance. Princess would\\ndrop down herself so that her front legs were on the ground, but would wait for\\nme to lift her hind legs down. If Agnes needed me to help her in any way in\\nbetween, Princess would wait in that position with her backside in the air until I\\nwas ready. Once down, she walked happily and painlessly, always wagging that\\n\\x0cbig, old tail.\\n\\nTuesdays were spent grocery shopping in the nearby village. A lot of elderly\\npeople I have worked with since have been very frugal. But Agnes was the\\nopposite. She was always trying to buy me things, particularly things I didn’t\\nneed or want. Every aisle would see us same two women, one elderly and one\\nyounger, arguing with each other. Both would be smiling and sometimes\\nlaughing, yet both of us determined. As a result, I would end up with half of\\nwhat Agnes wanted to buy me. This could be various vegetarian delicacies,\\nimported mangoes, a new hairbrush, a singlet, or some terrible tasting\\ntoothpaste.\\n\\nWednesdays were bingo, again in the local village. Her sight was deteriorating\\nso I was Agnes’s eyes, for confirmation at bingo. She could read the numbers\\nOK and hear relatively well, but checked with me to be sure, before she crossed\\noff each number. I loved all of the old people there. I was in my late-twenties\\nand the only young one, which left Agnes feeling very special. She would\\ndescribe me as ‘my friend’.\\n\\n“Well my friend and I went shopping yesterday and I bought her some new\\nunderpants,” she would announce seriously and proudly to all of her elderly\\nbingo friends.\\n\\nEveryone would nod and smile at me as I sat there thinking, “Oh brother”.\\n\\nOn she would go. “Her mother wrote to her this week from Australia. It is\\nvery hot there at the moment you know. And she has a new nephew.” Again the\\nheads would nod and smile.\\n\\nIt didn’t take me long to learn about editing how much information I gave her.\\nI hate to think what they would have known of my life otherwise, particularly\\nwhen Mum posted me some lovely lingerie and other gifts, to pamper me from\\nafar. But it was all innocent and loving with Agnes. So I managed to endure the\\nblushing and cringing she sometimes caused me.\\n\\nThursdays were the only day we stayed out over lunch. It was a big day out for\\nthe three of us, Princess included, of course. We would drive to a town in Kent\\nand have lunch with her daughter. Thirty miles was a long way away by English\\nstandards, but just down the road for an Australian. Our perspective of distance\\nis definitely a cultural difference.\\n\\nIn England, you can drive two miles and be in a whole new village. The accent\\nwill be totally different from the previous village and you may not know anyone,\\neven if you’ve lived in the other village all of your life. In Australia you can\\ndrive fifty miles for a loaf of bread. Your neighbours can be so far away they\\n\\x0cring you up or speak to you on the two-way radio to say hello, but they still think\\nof you as their neighbour. I once worked in an area in the Northern Territory that\\nwas so remote they flew planes to get to the nearest pub. The little airstrip would\\nbe full of single and two seater planes early in the evening and totally empty by\\nthe next morning, when they had all flown home to their cattle stations, half full\\nof grog.\\n\\nSo the big day out on Thursdays was indeed a big day out for Agnes, but a\\nlovely leisurely drive for me. Her daughter was a gentle woman and the\\noccasions pleasant. The two of them always had a ploughman’s lunch, with beef,\\ncheese, and pickles. I often marvelled at English people’s love of pickles. It was\\na good country for vegetarians too though. So my choices were never terribly\\nlimited. Being so cold, I usually enjoyed a warming soup or a hearty pasta dish.\\n\\nFridays were spent very local. We lived on a cattle farm with its own butcher\\nshop. The farm was run by two of Agnes’s sons. Our outing on Friday mornings\\nwas to the butcher shop. Although Agnes insisted on taking her time and looking\\nat everything in great detail, she bought the exact same things every week,\\nexactly. The butcher even offered to deliver her order, but no. “Thank you very\\nmuch but I must come and make my choice here,” she would reply politely.\\n\\nIn those days I was a vegetarian. I am a vegan now. Yet here I was living on a\\ncattle farm, not unlike how I had grown up. Even though I didn’t advocate eating\\nmeat, I did understand the business and the lifestyle. It was familiar territory\\nafter all.\\n\\nWe would wander back from the butcher shop and walk through the barn\\ntalking to the farmhands and to the cows. Agnes would plod along slowly with\\nher walking stick, me close by her side, and Princess behind us. It didn’t matter\\nhow cold the weather, we would just wear more layers. Fridays were always\\nspent this way, visiting the shop then the cows in their barn.\\n\\nI marvelled at how differently English cows were treated to Australian cows,\\nwith their warm barns and individual attention. But Australian cows did not have\\nto endure English winters. It still made me terribly sad getting to know these\\ncows on an individual basis though, knowing we would probably be buying their\\nflesh from the butcher shop at a later date. It was a hard thing to come to terms\\nwith and I never truly succeeded in doing so.\\n\\nThe vegetarian thing came up a lot at home despite my attempted silence and\\nmy respect for the family’s chosen lifestyle. I was never the kind of vegetarian or\\nvegan who would be overly verbal about it. Having seen what I have in my\\nupbringing though, and then being taken on a life-scarring school excursion to\\n\\x0cthe abattoirs, I do understand why some Vegos get so vocal and passionate about\\nit. It is heartbreaking when you find the bravery to look honestly at these\\nindustries and at what goes on behind the walls.\\n\\nBut I preferred to just live quietly and simply by example, respecting\\neveryone’s right to live the way that made sense to him or her. I only spoke of\\nmy beliefs if I was asked and was then happy to, since there was a genuine\\ninterest. It is interesting though, how almost-strangers from meat-eating paths\\nhave attacked me without provocation over the years, simply because of my\\nchoice not to eat animals. Perhaps this is partly why I chose to live a quiet\\nvegetarian life. I just wanted peace.\\n\\nSo when Agnes started questioning me about why I was a vegetarian, I\\nhesitated. Her very survival was based on the income from their cattle farm. In\\neffect, I guess mine was too, although I hadn’t related to that immediately. I took\\nthe job simply with the intention of saving money and brightening up an old\\nlady’s life.\\n\\nBut she persisted with her questions. So I told her about my feelings of\\nwatching cattle and sheep killed when I was a child and how affected by it I was,\\nhow much I loved animals, and how I had noticed that cows mooed differently\\nwhen they knew they were about to die. Their sounds of terror and panic still\\nhaunt me.\\n\\nThat was it. Agnes declared her vegetarianism on the spot. “Oh boy,” I\\nthought. “How am I going to explain this one to her family?” Speaking about it\\nwith her son soon after, he then spoke to Agnes of his desire for her to continue\\neating meat. But there was little budging at first. Agnes finally accepted eating\\nred meat one day a week, fish one day per week and chicken another day. The\\nfamily fed her on my days off, so she would be eating meat then too.\\n\\nOver time my views have strengthened and now I would not even consider\\naccepting a job that involved cooking flesh. But I did back then and I hated that\\npart of my role. I could never cook meat without being saddened that this was\\nonce a beautiful living thing, which had had feelings and a right to live. So I\\nliked this arrangement instantly, even though fish and chicken were certainly still\\nanimals, by my way of thinking.\\n\\nIt turned out though, that Agnes had only agreed with her son Bill in order to\\nkeep the peace. She had no intention of eating any meat at all during the week.\\nSo I spent the remaining winter and spring months cooking us up delicious\\nvegetarian feasts of nut-loaf bakes, divine soups, colourful stir-fries, and\\ngourmet pizzas. I think Agnes would have happily lived on boiled eggs\\n\\x0cotherwise and of course, baked beans. She was English after all and the English\\ndo love their beans.\\n\\nThe snow melted as the daffodils bloomed into spring. Days grew longer and\\nblue skies returned. As the farm came to life again, newborn calves ran around\\non their wobbly, skinny legs. Birds returned and greeted us in song every day.\\nPrincess moulted even more. Agnes and I removed our winter coats and hats,\\nand carried on with our same routine for another couple of months, enjoying the\\nspring sunshine. We were two ladies of very different generations, walking arm\\nin arm day after day, as we shared continuous laughter and stories.\\n\\nTravel was calling though. We had both known from the start that I would be\\ngoing. I was missing Dean too. The weekends were not enough time together\\nanymore and we were keen to head off travelling together. My job was\\nadvertised before long and our days started winding up. Those months with\\nAgnes were a wonderful and special experience. Although I had accepted it\\nmostly as a job for the benefit of my travel yearnings, companionship was\\nbeautiful work.\\n\\nIt was much more enjoyable for me than pulling beers. I would rather help\\nsomeone walk steady because she is old and frail, than someone who is young\\nand drunk, or even old and drunk. Plenty of both had been done during my\\nemployment on the island and in the English pub. I much preferred looking for\\nan old lady’s teeth to removing dirty ashtrays and empty pint glasses.\\n\\nDean and I travelled to the Middle East where we marvelled at vastly\\ndifferent, but fascinating cultures (and ate heaps of delicious food). After a\\nwonderful year or so away, I went back to visit Agnes. Another Australian girl\\nhad replaced me and we had an enjoyable long yarn, after Agnes had drifted off\\nto sleep in her armchair. Sharing lots of stories, she admitted to being somewhat\\npuzzled by the first question Bill had asked when he interviewed her. I asked\\nwhat that was and cracked up laughing when she told me.\\n\\nThe very first question Bill had asked was, “You’re not a vegetarian, are you?”\\n\\x0cAN UNEXPECTED CAREER PATH.\\neter\\n\\nAfter those years in England and the Middle East, I finally came home to my\\nbeloved Australia. I was a changed person, as one is after travel. Returning to\\nwork in the banking industry, it soon became obvious that this work would never\\nsatisfy me again. Customer service was the only highlight of the role now and\\nwhile it was easy to pick up work in any town, I was restless and desperately\\nunhappy in my working life.\\n\\nCreative expression was also starting to flow from me. Now living in Western\\nAustralia, I sat by the Swan River in Perth one day and made two lists. One list\\nwas what I was good at. The other one was what I loved to do. From this I had to\\nacknowledge there was an artist of sorts within me, as the only things that landed\\nin both columns were creative talents.\\n\\n“Dare I think I could be an artist?” I thought to myself. Despite growing up\\naround musicians, the reliability of a ‘good job’ has also been instilled in me,\\nhence, why no one could understand my restlessness with a steady nine to five\\nexistence in the banking game. They were ‘good jobs’; good jobs that were\\nslowly but surely killing me.\\n\\nIntensive soul searching unfolded, as I tried to work out what I could do well,\\nbut also enjoy. They were hard times as everything was changing within me. I\\nfinally came to the conclusion that I would have to eventually be working from\\nthe heart, as working only from the intellect had already left me too empty and\\ndissatisfied. So I began developing my creative skills through writing and\\nphotography, which led to songwriting and performing eventually, in a long and\\nroundabout way. All the while I was still working in banking jobs, though\\nmostly as temporary staff now. The trappings of a full-time job were just not\\npossible to endure anymore.\\n\\nPerth was a long way from anywhere though and as much as I loved living\\nthere, the desire to be more accessible to those I cherished saw the eastern states\\ncalling me back. So across the mighty Nullarbor Plains it was, through the\\nFlinders Ranges, along the Great Ocean Road, up through the New England\\nHighway, until Queensland declared itself home for the next while. Some of this\\ntime found me working in a call centre for people subscribing to an adult movie\\n\\x0cchannel. It was far more interesting than the banking industry at times.\\n\\n“Um.”\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\n“I’m just ringing up for my husband.”\\n\\n“So you would like to subscribe to ‘Night Moves’ then?” I would reply in a\\nfriendly, accepting tone, always putting the women at ease.\\n\\nOr the guys would ask, “What’s it like? I mean. Do you see everything?”\\n\\n“T am sorry sir. I’ve not viewed it myself. But I can offer you a one night trial\\nfor $6.95 and if you like it enough, you can call back and subscribe to it on a\\nmonthly basis.”\\n\\nAnd of course, there were the expected calls of, “What colour knickers have\\nyou got on?” Bronnie hangs up. But when the giggles had subsided, it was\\nsimply another office job. Friendships were formed with other staff, which made\\nit more enjoyable. But my restlessness continued to fester.\\n\\nWe moved back to my home state of New South Wales. Dean, the man I had\\nbeen with in England and the Middle East, had moved back to Australia with\\nme. Soon after we relocated back to New South Wales, our relationship came to\\nan end. We had loved each other dearly for years now and had been best friends\\nfor most of that time. It was devastating to watch our friendship fall apart. But\\nour numerous lifestyle differences could no longer be swept under the carpet or\\nlaughed off, as had once been done.\\n\\nI was a vegetarian. He was meat eater. Working indoors all week, I longed for\\noutdoor life all weekend. He worked outdoors all week and wanted to be indoors\\nall weekend. The list went on and on, and seemed to grow larger by the week.\\nThe things each of us delighted in, no longer delighted the other. A mutual love\\nof music still bonded us and kept us hanging in there for a while. But in the end,\\nthe communication channel between us lost its strength and we each battled with\\nour own loss, watching our shared dreams disintegrate before our eyes.\\n\\nIt was a heartbreaking time as the relationship finished and the grief of such\\nloss arrived. As I curled up in a ball sobbing, wishing we could have made it\\nwork, I knew in my heart we couldn’t. Life was calling us in different directions\\nand the relationship was now hindering our paths rather than helping them.\\n\\nThe search for more meaning in my life intensified and as a result, the work\\nissue increased in prominence. Waking up to the fact that being an artist is a very\\nhard way to survive, until your work has gained momentum and a healthy\\nreputation, I had to find a new direction in the meantime. Surviving as an artist\\nwas going to be possible eventually. If I could dream it, I could do it after all.\\n\\x0cBut I needed to get back to earning and I needed to do it in a field that allowed\\nme to work from the heart and to be my natural self. The pressure of selling\\nproducts within the banking industry had increased and I had changed too much.\\nI no longer fitted into that world, if I ever truly had. Determined to continue on\\nmy creative journey, the choice was made to work as a live-in companion again.\\nAt least then I wouldn’t be stuck in a rent or a mortgage grind, which would also\\nfree me up from the rigidity of routine.\\n\\nDespite the years of soul searching that had led up to this point, the final\\ndecision was almost a casual, flippant one. Simply, I’d take a job as a companion\\nfor the benefit of my creative path and to also work from the heart, all the while\\nenabling me to live rent-free. I had no idea then that my yearnings for a heart-felt\\njob had been so clearly heard, and the years to follow were in themselves going\\nto be such a significant part of my life and my life’s work.\\n\\nWithin two weeks, I had moved into a harbour-side home in one of the\\nSydney’s most exclusive suburbs. Her elderly brother had found my client Ruth\\nunconscious on her kitchen floor. After more than a month in hospital she was\\nallowed home, providing she had twenty-four hour care.\\n\\nMy experience in the care industry had only been companionship with Agnes\\nthose years prior. I had not looked after sick people and was honest about this to\\nthe agency employing me, but they didn’t mind. Carers who were willing to live-\\nin were a commodity and they were not going to let me slip through their net.\\n“Just pretend you know what you’re doing and call us if you need any help.”\\nHoly dooly, welcome to the care-game Bronnie.\\n\\nMy natural empathy enabled me to do the job reasonably well for a new\\nperson. I simply treated Ruth as I would my own grandmother, who had been\\nprecious to me. Catering to her needs as they surfaced, I worked it out as I went\\nalong. The community nurse would come in every few days and ask me\\nquestions about things I had no idea about. Because I was honest with her, she\\nended up helping me enormously as I learned about medications, personal care,\\nand industry jargon.\\n\\nMy employers would drop in now and then too. Happy that the client was\\nhappy was enough for them and off they’d go. They had no idea I was becoming\\nemotionally and physically exhausted in a rapid time. I am not sure I had yet\\nrealised it myself.\\n\\nRuth’s family was pleased because I was spoiling Ruth rotten. There were foot\\nmassages, manicures, facials, and lots of lovely bedside conversations over cups\\nof tea. Like I say, I treated her as I would my own dear grandmother. I didn’t\\n\\x0cknow any other way.\\n\\nRuth would ring her bell throughout the night too and I’d be down the stairs in\\na flash, helping her onto the bedside commode to go to the toilet. “Oh you are\\nglamorous,” she would to say to me as I wandered in. Her impression of my\\nglamour was that I sometimes wore my hair in a bun to bed, simply because I\\nwas too exhausted to get the knots out at the time. And my so-called ‘glamorous’\\nnightdress was due to my mother’s insistence I take it.\\n\\n“You can’t go to this lady’s place and sleep naked or in any old thing,” Mum\\nhad pleaded. “Please take this and promise me you will wear it.” So in respect of\\nmy darling mother’s wishes, I found myself wearing a satin nightdress to bed.\\nGlamorous I was, half sleepwalking into her bedroom four or five times a night,\\neyes struggling to open, longing for reprieve from my exhausted state. Ruth\\nwould need me all of the following day too, so little chance was ever presented\\nto catch up on a few hour’s sleep. I was also doing housework, which I tackled\\nduring Ruth’s afternoon naps.\\n\\nSitting on the commode, she would also want to talk then. Ruth loved all of\\nthe attention after years of living on her own. I was enjoying our friendship too,\\nexcept for hearing about what cups and saucers they had used at whatever dinner\\nparty thirty years ago, while she urinated on the commode at three in the\\nmorning, my body just longing to return to bed.\\n\\nOver the weeks, Ruth spoke of the years around the bay and of the children\\nplaying down by the harbour. Horse and dray, plodding along through all of the\\nquiet streets, had done the milk and bread deliveries. Sundays would see the\\nneighbourhood all dressed in their best clothes for church. Ruth spoke about her\\nchildren when they were young and of her husband long since passed. Her\\ndaughter Heather, who I found to be delightful, would drop in every day or two\\nand was a breath of fresh air. Ruth’s son and his family lived out in the country\\nand had Heather not also mentioned her brother, it would have been easy to\\nforget his existence. He did not play an active role in his mother’s life.\\n\\nHeather was the rock that supported Ruth throughout her decades as a widow.\\nRuth’s elderly brother James also helped. He would wander down from his home\\nabout a mile away, every afternoon. You could set the clock by his visit. There\\nhe was in the same sweater, day-in, day-out. He was already eighty-eight years\\nold and had never married. With a mind as clear as they come, he was a\\nwonderful character and it was my pleasure to know him and to enjoy the\\nsimplicity of his life.\\n\\nRuth was not recovering from her illness however and was still in bed after a\\n\\x0cmonth. More tests were done and it was then I was informed that she was dying.\\n\\nWalking down to the harbour with tears in my eyes, everything felt surreal.\\nChildren were playing in the shallow water. The footbridge hanging over the bay\\nswung lightly as happy people walked over it. Ferries cruised by on their way to\\nCircular Quay in the city centre. I walked as in a dream, as laughter rang out\\nfrom a group of people having a picnic.\\n\\nSitting against a sandstone cliff, the water almost at my feet, I looked up at the\\nbeautiful sky. It was one of those perfect winter days, when the warmth of the\\nsun is like a balm. Sydney is never totally freezing in winter, not like European\\nwinters. It was a glorious day, where a light coat was sufficient. Having already\\ngrown close to Ruth, the thought of her passing left me tearful for my own\\ninevitable pain. The shock that I would be losing her was my first reaction. My\\ntears flowed as a yacht sailed by, full of happy, healthy people. It then also hit\\nme that I would be her carer, the one nursing her until the end.\\n\\nGrowing up on the cattle farm, then a sheep farm, I had seen a lot of animals\\ndying or dead. It was not new to me, although I was still always terribly sensitive\\nto it. But the society I was living in, the modern society of Western culture, was\\nnot one that exposed its people to dying bodies on a regular basis. It wasn’t like\\nsome cultures where human death is out in the open and a very visible part of\\neveryday life.\\n\\nOur society has shut death out, almost as a denial of its existence. This denial\\nleaves both the dying person and the family or friends totally unprepared for\\nsomething that is inevitable. We are all going to die. But rather than\\nacknowledge the existence of death, we try to hide it. It is as if we are trying to\\nconvince ourselves that ‘out of sight, out of mind’ really works. But it doesn’t,\\nbecause we carry on trying to validate ourselves through our material life and\\nassociated fearful behaviour instead.\\n\\nIf we are able to face our own inevitable death with honest acceptance, before\\nwe have reached that time, then we shift our priorities well before it is too late.\\nThis gives us the opportunity to then put our energies into directions of true\\nvalue. Once we acknowledge that limited time is remaining, although we don’t\\nknow if that is years, weeks or hours, we are less driven by ego or by what other\\npeople think of us. Instead, we are more driven by what our hearts truly want.\\nThis acknowledgment of our inevitable, approaching death, offers us the\\nopportunity to find greater purpose and satisfaction in the time we have\\nremaining.\\n\\nI came to realise how detrimental this denial is in our society. But at the time,\\n\\x0con that sunny winter’s day, it simply left me completely ignorant of what lay\\nahead with Ruth and of my role in caring for her. Resting my head back against\\nthe sandstone wall, I prayed for strength. Having already faced plenty of\\nchallenges in my upbringing and adult life, I believed I wouldn’t have been\\nbrought to this place had I not been capable of doing the job. This didn’t\\nparticularly ease my personal sadness and pain.\\n\\nBut sitting in the warmth of the sun that day, quiet tears falling, I knew I had a\\njob to do and would give Ruth all of the happiness and comfort I possibly could\\nfor her dying weeks. I sat for a long time, contemplating life and how I hadn’t\\nseen this coming. Yet I was also accepting that I had gifts to share and this is\\nwhat I was being asked to do. Walking back to the house a strong resolve\\ndeveloped within me. I would give this situation the absolute best I had, and\\nwould catch up on sleep later.\\n\\nMy employer dropped in later that day. Explaining that I had never even seen\\na dead person, let alone cared for someone towards their passing, I heard my\\nwords fall on deaf ears. “The family loves you. You’ll be right.”\\n\\n‘You'll be right’ (as in, ‘You’ll be alright’), is such a common expression in\\nAustralian language that I accepted I would be. Ruth’s deterioration was quite\\nfast from that point. Other carers came in to relieve me on days off and as her\\nneeds increased, I was relieved of night duty. I was still called on by the other\\ncarers, as I oversaw the running of things. But, at least sleep was now possible.\\n\\nThe days were still special and more often than not, it was mostly just Ruth\\nand I. It was a quiet neighbourhood, with occasional laughter ringing up through\\nthe trees from the harbour-side park below. Heather would drop in on us, as\\nwould James and a string of specialists doing their jobs. The learning on offer\\nwas immense and I was growing enormously in my role, without then realising\\nthe full extent of it. I simply did whatever needed doing and asked a lot of\\nquestions from everyone I could.\\n\\nOne morning as I was about to leave for two days off, excited to be heading\\nout of the city to visit my cousin and to enjoy some lightness after the weight of\\nit all, I noticed the smell from the bedroom. The night carer had either not\\nnoticed it, or had not wanted to, hoping it could be left for the day carer who was\\nabout to come on. I saw a lot of this in coming years.\\n\\nThere was no way I could leave my beautiful friend lying in it for another\\nminute. Her bowels had opened and evacuated completely. Lying limp, Ruth was\\nonly able to reply to me with quiet grunts. Her major organs were collapsing.\\nThe night carer reluctantly tore herself away from the gossip magazine she was\\n\\x0creading and helped me, as we cleaned this gentle woman and changed her sheets\\nfrom underneath her. It was a relief when the day carer arrived, dropped\\neverything and pitched in immediately with pleasant cheer. We had Ruth clean\\nand resting, and in no time she was in a deep sleep, exhausted.\\n\\nSitting out in the bush with my cousin later that day, my heart was still back at\\nthe house. Welcoming the lightness and humour his company always provides, I\\nwas glad to be hanging out with him. But it was not going to be possible for me\\nto stay away for two nights. Ruth was in my thoughts too much and I was sure\\nshe didn’t have that long left. I had only been at my cousin’s for a few hours\\nwhen my employer called and said that Ruth was in her last stages and could I\\ncome?\\n\\nArriving back around dark, the somber mood of the house was palpable before\\neven walking inside. Heather was there with her husband, as well as the new\\nnight carer who had just arrived. She was a lovely Irish girl.\\n\\nHeather asked would I mind if she went home? I replied gently that she had to\\ndo whatever felt right for her. So home it was. After she had left though, it was\\ninitially a little difficult for me to remove judgment from the situation. I could\\nonly imagine my own mother dying and how I would move heaven and earth to\\nbe with her at her passing.\\n\\nThey say that everything comes down to love or fear: every emotion, every\\naction, and every thought. I concluded that fear was driving Heather’s decision\\nand for that I felt a rush of compassion and love for her. From the start of our\\nassociation, I had found her to be a very practical person and somewhat\\ndetached. But this situation was foreign to me. I didn’t want my own beliefs and\\nconditioning to hinder my regard for someone I had come to care for, simply\\nbecause she handled things differently to how I would have.\\n\\nSitting in the darkened room with Erin, the other carer, I came to accept and\\nrespect Heather’s actions. She did what she’d had to do, because she had done\\nall she could. For decades, she had kept her mother’s life in order as well as that\\nof her own family. She was completely and totally exhausted by now, both\\nphysically and emotionally. She had given all she possibly could and wanted to\\nremember her mum sleeping peacefully, as she was when Heather left. I smiled\\nwith respect and my assumed understanding.\\n\\nIn conversation with Heather in the days afterwards however, I found out that\\nRuth had implied to Heather that she wanted her to go. Heather knew her mother\\nwell enough to read her wishes. So it had been in love she left, not fear at all.\\nSimilar situations also became somewhat familiar in the years to come. Not\\n\\x0cevery dying person wanted his or her family there. They said their goodbyes\\nwhile conscious and occasionally preferred to be seen out by carers, allowing\\ntheir families to keep other memories instead.\\n\\nErin and I chatted quietly in Ruth’s room, the presence of death lingering. Erin\\nexplained how in her family, the room would be filled with everyone by now.\\nAunts, uncles, cousins, neighbours, and children, everyone would come along to\\nsay his or her farewell, to send the person out.\\n\\nWe fell into spells of silence, both of us looking at Ruth, watching, and\\nwaiting. The night was incredibly still as I quietly sent Ruth love from my heart.\\nErin and I would chat a little again, then go back into silence. She was a\\nbeautiful person to share the experience with, as she cared. It was in her\\nnaturally to do so.\\n\\n“She’s opened her eyes,” Erin suddenly said to me, startled. Ruth had been in\\na semi coma for the entire shift so far. “She’s looking at you.”\\n\\nI moved closer to the bed and held Ruth’s hand. “I’m here, Sweetheart. It’s\\nOK.”\\n\\nShe looked directly into my eyes and a moment later her spirit began to leave\\nthe body. It shook for a short time. Then all was still.\\n\\nInstantly, tears rolled down my cheeks. Speaking silently to her from my heart,\\nI thanked Ruth for what we had shared, told her I loved her and wished her well\\non her journey. It was a very reverent moment, full of stillness and love.\\nStanding in the darkened room, all of my senses alive, I silently thought what\\nblessings I had been given by having this time with her.\\n\\nThen Ruth’s body surprisingly took another huge breath. I jumped back,\\nswearing, my heart beating out of my chest. “Holy Shit!” I said to Erin.\\n\\nShe laughed at me. “That’s quite normal you know Bronnie. It happens a lot.”\\n\\n“Yes well, thanks for telling me,” I replied in shock, smiling at her. My heart\\nwas pounding hard and all of the reverence of the moment was gone. I stepped\\nback beside the bed with great hesitance. “Is it going to happen again?” I\\nwhispered to Erin.\\n\\n“Tt could.”\\n\\nWe waited in silence for another minute or so, hardly breathing ourselves.\\n“She’s gone Erin. I can feel she’s gone,” I finally said.\\n\\n“God bless her,” we both uttered quietly, at the same time. Moving our chairs\\ncloser, we sat with Ruth for a while in sacred silence and loving respect. I also\\nneeded to settle a bit, after the fright of the moment before.\\n\\nHeather and my employer had asked me to call them when it had happened,\\n\\x0cwhich I did. It was about two thirty in the morning. There was no more either of\\nthem could do now. I’d also been directed earlier that day with how to proceed\\nfrom here. So I called the doctor to come and issue a death certificate. When that\\nwas done, the funeral home was called.\\n\\nErin and I sat in the kitchen until Ruth’s body was taken away about the time\\nthe sun was coming up. During those hours of waiting, we both went back to\\nlook in on Ruth at times. It was a compulsion to still care for her body, even\\nthough she had departed from it. I didn’t like her being in the room alone. The\\nstrange, dark time afterwards was very special in a way. But there was also a\\ntangible emptiness in the home that night, after she had passed over.\\n\\nRuth’s home was offered to me the next day as a house-sitting situation.\\nHeather said it would take months for the estate to settle and rather than leave\\nthe house empty, the family would feel more secure to have someone living in it.\\nSo I went on to live in Ruth’s home for some time afterwards, which was a\\nblessing for my physical situation. It was also good to be somewhere that had\\nnow become familiar to me.\\n\\nI had realised the around-the-clock live-in work was going to be too\\nexhausting. Never being able to do anything by halves, I now understood I\\nwould need to remove myself from future patients between shifts, by going\\nhome each night. Care work asked much more of me than straightforward\\ncompanionship.\\n\\nOver the following months, I watched and assisted as Heather moved Ruth’s\\nbelongings onto new places. Her physical world was dismantled one piece at a\\ntime, as happens to everyone. I had been nomadic for so long that I still had an\\naversion to owning too much. As a result, I declined many things Heather kindly\\noffered to me. They were just things after all and while they had belonged to my\\nfriend Ruth, I knew her memory would stay on in my heart, as it has.\\n\\nI did fall in love with a couple of old lamps though and they are with me to\\nthis day. Ruth’s home was later demolished by the new owners and replaced with\\na modern concrete creation. The old frangipani tree that had thrown summer\\nscents throughout the home for decades was crushed in the blink of an eye and\\nreplaced with a lap pool. An invitation arrived for me to the housewarming party\\nof the new place.\\n\\nThe people who had bought Ruth’s home had been uncomfortable with the\\nspiders and their webs across the trees in the garden. Yet Ruth and I had\\npreviously sat in the sun room watching the Golden Orb spider weave a web so\\nstrong you could lift it up to walk under. It was a marvel we had both loved and\\n\\x0cshared. Standing near the lap pool, looking at all of the new, fashionable plants\\nthat had replaced an established garden of love and longevity, I was delighted to\\nsee a Golden Orb spider weaving her web high across one of the new plants.\\n\\nI sent love to Ruth with a smile and knew that in her own way, she was\\nvisiting me there that day. Her home may be gone but her spirit was with me. I\\nthanked the new owner for the invitation, had a chat and walked down to the\\nharbour. Sitting where I had the day I first heard about Ruth being terminally ill,\\nI felt grateful for all we had shared and for all I had learned through our\\nassociation.\\n\\nOn that summer’s day, I smiled realising just how much more I had been given\\nback then, a lot more than just living rent-free. As the happy day unfolded before\\nme, I continued to smile in gratitude. And by having directed my vision to that\\nGolden Orb spider, Ruth had already smiled back.\\n\\x0cHONESTY AND SURRENDER\\neter\\n\\nA few random shifts came my way after Ruth’s departure. At shift handover I\\nmet other carers. This was the only brief time of socialising with other staff.\\nThroughout the long twelve-hour shifts, there was no team banter or laughter as\\nhandover was the only time we ever saw each other. The client, family and\\nmedical professionals who dropped in became the only contact.\\n\\nThis made the relationships even more personal. It also gave me time to\\noccasionally read, write, continue my meditation practice, or do some yoga.\\nMany of the carers went crazy with too much time to themselves and it was not\\nunusual to arrive at a house and find the television on before breakfast. Grateful\\nthat I loved my own company, the long hours of silence suited me quite well.\\nEven if there were people around, with a dying person in the home they were\\nusually peaceful environments.\\n\\nWalking into Stella’s home in the tree-lined suburb, this was definitely the\\ncase. It wasn’t just the fact that she was dying. These were peaceful, gentle\\npeople. Stella had long, straight, white hair. Graceful was the first word that\\ncame to mind when we met, despite the fact she was lying ill in bed. Her\\nhusband George was a beautiful man and welcomed me naturally.\\n\\nHaving to accept a family member is dying is an enormous life changing time\\nin itself. When that person reaches the stage of needing twenty-four hour care\\nhowever, everything about the life these people knew has disappeared. Their\\nprivacy and the special moments of just the two of them in the home are gone\\nforever.\\n\\nCarers came and went, changing shifts morning and night. Some were regular\\nbut some only came once, in between their own regular clients. So there were\\nnew faces to deal with, new personalities and varying work ethics. Before long\\nthough, I became the regular day carer for Stella. A community nurse would also\\nvisit, as would the palliative doctor. He was a man I saw briefly with many\\nclients over the following years and what a special, delightful, kindhearted\\nperson he was.\\n\\nAfter the experiences with Ruth, my employer said I’d handled it beautifully\\nand offered me more training in palliative care, if I would like to go down that\\n\\x0croad. I accepted this offer, as I felt that life was calling me in this direction for\\nnow. The time and learning with Ruth had had a profound effect on me, leaving\\na desire to grow and experience more in this field.\\n\\nMy training involved two workshops. One of these was to show myself and\\nother carers how to wash our hands properly. The other was a very brief display\\nin lifting procedures. That was pretty much it, my full extent of formal training.\\nThen sending me off to work with Stella, my employer told me not to tell them\\nI’d only ever had one palliative client. She believed I could do the job, as did I.\\n\\nHonesty had always been a significant part of my personality. But when\\nquestions came up from the family about my experience, I found myself lying,\\nall because I needed the work. New laws were also coming in about staff\\nqualifications, of which I had none. Even though I couldn’t prove my skills by\\nspeaking of previous experience however, I did also want Stella’s family to feel\\nat ease with me. I knew in my heart I could do the job well, as it was about\\ngentleness and intuition more than anything. So I went along with the lies,\\nsaying I had nursed more people than I had when they asked. Lying felt so\\nuncomfortable for me though, I could never do it with another client.\\n\\nStella was very much into hygiene and wanted clean sheets on the bed every\\nday. But she was also a lady of style and insisted on wearing a matching\\nnightdress to go with the colour or pattern of the sheets. George laughed to me\\none day that he had found himself in trouble for choosing the wrong sheets for\\nthe nightdress she wanted to wear. I said to him laughing, as I ended up saying to\\nthe families of almost all of my future clients, “Whatever makes her happy”.\\n\\nAnd so it was that this tall graceful woman lay dying in her choice of sheets\\nand nightdress when she asked me about my life.\\n\\n“Do you meditate?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes I do,” I happily replied. It was not a question I had expected.\\n\\nStella continued. “What path do you follow?” I told her and she nodded in\\nunderstanding.\\n\\n“Do you do yoga?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes I do,” I again replied, “but not as much as I’d like to”.\\n\\n“Do you meditate daily?”\\n\\nI said, “Yes. Twice a day.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile, when after a moment she replied with a gentle voice,\\n“Oh thank God. I have been waiting for you for ages. I can die now”.\\n\\nStella had been a yoga instructor for forty years, long before yoga had become\\nan everyday thing in Western culture. Back then it was something strange from\\n\\x0cthe East. She had been to India several times and was very devoted to her path.\\n\\nOriginally, because it was too out-there for the world they lived in, Stella had\\nsaid she was an exercise instructor when asked, rather than a yoga teacher. As\\nsociety thankfully evolved over time and yoga became more mainstream, she\\ncame out of her shell and taught many students the arts and wisdom of this path.\\n\\nHer husband was a retired professional who still did a little work from home.\\nHe pottered about peacefully and I enjoyed his presence. The home library was\\nfull of spiritual classics. Many I had read, but many I had wanted to and as yet\\nhadn’t. It was a reader’s dreams come true, particularly for one so interested in\\nphilosophy, psychology, and spirituality. I devoured them as much as possible.\\nStella would stir from her sleep, ask what book I was reading, where I was up to\\nin the book, and pass comment on it. She knew them all. When she was alert\\nenough for long conversations, which wasn’t often enough, it was always about\\nphilosophy. We shared many theories and found our thinking not terribly\\ndifferent from each other.\\n\\nMy yoga practice also improved greatly. I didn’t feel I had to hide what I was\\ndoing, or go off into another room. The door to Stella’s bedroom was never\\nclosed, so fresh air blew through unhindered at all times. It was a lovely space to\\nwork in. Stella’s peaceful white cat called Yogi would lie on the end of her bed\\nand watch me. As the afternoons in the neighbourhood were particularly\\npeaceful, I used that time the most to stretch and breathe. Thinking Stella was\\nasleep, I would be delighted when she would pass a comment on something I\\nwas doing and how to improve that posture or to try another similar one, perhaps\\nmore dynamic and challenging, before she dozed off again.\\n\\nAt the time, I had been doing yoga for about five years. It had begun in\\nFremantle, a suburb of Perth, whilst living over in Western Australia. Twice a\\nweek I would jump on my pushbike and ride down to Fremantle from a couple\\nof suburbs away. Kale was the teacher. He truly was a wonderful introduction for\\nme to yoga. He hadn’t found his own way to it until late in life. Back injury drew\\nhim to it. Obviously life had big plans for him and he did find his calling, much\\nto the benefit of his many devoted students.\\n\\nWhen we had left Perth, life became unsettled for some time. But yoga\\ncontinued to call. Wherever I was living, I would search for a new class and\\nsometimes join one briefly. But finding a class I could connect with as much as I\\nhad Kale’s was in vain. It was not to be found.\\n\\nDuring my time in Stella’s bedroom, I came to see how I hadn’t truly\\nconnected with my practice, as I was still looking to the teacher for the\\n\\x0cconnection, instead of myself. This was changed permanently thanks to her\\nguidance. I have enjoyed other classes since, as they push me a bit further than\\nmay happen in my home practice. They are also a great way to meet up with\\nlike-minded people. But my home practice doesn’t waiver now, as the practice\\nitself is the teacher. Stella had made her mark on her final student.\\n\\nHer biggest frustration was that she was ready to die and it wasn’t happening.\\nI would arrive of a moming and ask how she was feeling. “Well how do you\\nthink I am feeling?” she would reply. “I am still here and I don’t want to be.”\\n\\nShe was also unable to meditate anymore. After all of Stella’s years of mental\\ndiscipline and the connection she had experienced with herself through\\nmeditation, she thought it would be a natural thing now as she approached her\\nreturn home. In fact, she thought her practice would intensify. But it was my\\npractice that did. Every afternoon when she drifted off again, I would do my\\nafternoon sit. “You’re so lucky,” she would say to me later. “This is so\\nfrustrating. I can’t meditate and I can’t die.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you are still here for me. Perhaps there are still things that I need to\\nlearn through you and that is why your time has not yet come,” I suggested.\\n\\nShe nodded. “I can accept that.”\\n\\nAs is always the case when any two people interact though, we were there to\\nlearn through each other. When I broached the subject of surrender, Stella began\\nto find more peace within. As I sat beside her bed and spoke of days gone by, of\\nlearning to let go, she listened with interest.\\n\\nOver the years, I had lived from one leap of faith to the next. I told her how I\\nhad hit the road south years earlier with nothing but a full tank of fuel, fifty\\ndollars, and an intention to move somewhere cooler for a while. With a town on\\nthe far south coast of New South Wales in mind, I headed off in that general\\ndirection. Visiting friends along the way, I found a couple of day’s work, which\\nallowed me to continue the trip. Having already been so nomadic, I had friends\\ndotted all over the place and it was wonderful to see them again, some I’d not\\nseen for almost a decade. I eventually arrived in the town intended but with little\\nmoney.\\n\\nA caravan park on the headland had the best view in town, overlooking the\\nmighty Pacific Ocean. So I stopped there for a night. The back seat of my old\\njeep had been removed and replaced with a mattress. Curtains went up before I’d\\nhit the road and there it was, I was mobile. Checking out the work opportunities\\nin the town, things looked a bit challenging initially. But it was autumn, my\\nfavourite time of year. So I just savoured the perfect weather for a couple of days\\n\\x0cand did a lot of walking.\\n\\nPaying for my site at the caravan park though, was not going to be possible on\\nan ongoing basis. My money was running out and I was really only there for a\\nshower and as a base, while I made some contacts. So I bought some food and\\nheaded into the bush, following signs to an inland river not far away. Having\\nlived by leaps of faith before, I knew I would have to face my fears head-on yet\\nagain. If I was going to will something to me through faith alone, I had to get my\\nhead out of the way and that is always the hardest thing.\\n\\nUnhealthy patterns surfaced in my mind, results from my past conditioning\\nand society telling me I couldn’t live this way. Fear started rearing its ugly head\\nas I wondered how on Earth it was all going to come together, yet again.\\nBringing myself back to the present moment was the only thing that had saved\\nme before and was the only thing that would save me now. And there is no better\\nplace to face your fears than in nature, where you can get back into the true\\nrhythm of life.\\n\\nWhen fears were sleeping, I enjoyed wonderful days in a_ healthy,\\nuncomplicated routine of eating simple, wholesome food, swimming in the\\ncleansing, crystal clear river, watching the curious faces of wildlife come and go,\\nlistening to birds with a variety of songs, and reading. It was a reverent time,\\nspacious and beautiful.\\n\\nAlmost two weeks went by before I saw another person. The day I did see\\npeople was pleasant. It was a family of three generations, out at the river for a\\npicnic lunch. This told me it was probably the weekend. I left my jeep open and\\nwent for a big bushwalk, giving them the place to enjoy. In the late afternoon I\\nlay in the back of the jeep, still with the back and windows wide open, and read\\nfor a while. The beautiful light of dusk filtered magically through the trees.\\n\\nAs the family was leaving, the woman my age, the mother of the two children,\\nbroke away from the group. Her husband, parents and children continued to their\\ncar. She walked over to me quietly and lent inside my jeep. I looked up from my\\nbook a little startled and smiled, as she simply whispered to me “I envy your\\nfreedom”. With that we both laughed and she left, without another word or time\\nfor me to reply.\\n\\nLying in the jeep that night, the curtains open, frogs singing by the river, anda\\nblanket of a million stars keeping me company, I smiled thinking of her. She was\\nright. I was as free as they come. I didn’t have enough money or food beyond the\\nnext few days, but right at that moment, I was as free as a person could be.\\n\\nPeople have often asked me since about the various trips I did to the bush and\\n\\x0cother places in the country, and if I was ever scared for my safety. The answer\\nwas no, rarely did I have reason to be. There were a couple of potentially dodgy\\nsituations, like the hitch hiking thing. But I came out OK and put those rare\\noccasions down to good learning. As every move was done intuitively, I tried as\\nbest to always move forward with trust, knowing I would be looked after.\\n\\nWe are mostly social creatures though, so I headed into town again. I phoned\\nmy mother, with whom I have a healthy and loving relationship. Being a mother,\\nshe was always a little concerned for my welfare. But another part of her\\nunderstood that nomadic life was a part of me. She didn’t judge my choices, but\\nwas always relieved to hear from me. The day before she had spent two dollars\\non a lottery ticket, with the intention of winning me some money. She is such a\\nnaturally generous person that life blessed her.\\n\\n“You give to me in so many other ways,” she said. “I insist you take this\\nmoney. It was with the intention of helping you that it came to me anyway.” So I\\ngratefully found myself with money to get through another couple of weeks.\\n\\nWaking up in my jeep at the caravan park the next morning, I headed down to\\nthe rocks to watch the sunrise over the ocean. I love that first glimpse of light,\\nwhere there are still stars out but a whole new day is coming. As the sky turned\\npink then orange, I sat on the rocks watching a pod of playful dolphins\\nswimming by, flipping themselves out of the water for pure delight. I knew then\\nthat everything was going to turn out just fine.\\n\\nAfter a long and enjoyable chat about life and travel later in the day, the owner\\nof the park returned to my jeep dangling a key. “I don’t need van number eight\\nfor another ten days. It is yours and I will not allow you to pay one cent for it. If\\nmy daughter was sleeping in the back of her car, I would hope someone would\\ndo the same for her,” Ted declared.\\n\\n“Bless you Ted, thank you,” I said fighting back tears of gratitude.\\n\\nSo I had a roof over my head for the next ten nights and somewhere to cook.\\nDuring this time though, fears were starting to rage fiercely in me again about\\nmy situation. I had to earn some money. My food supply was again diminishing.\\nEach day, I visited all of the businesses in town and while I met plenty of fine\\npeople, no work was forthcoming. Walking back up the hill to the headland and\\ncaravan, I took a deep breath, trying to stay present, but trying to find a solution\\ntoo.\\n\\nI hated this part of my life, this compulsion to always throw caution to the\\nwind and create such challenging situations for myself, time and again. Yet it\\nwas also addictive. Each time I did this, I challenged my fears head-on and\\n\\x0csomehow I always, always landed on my feet again. In some ways each leap of\\nfaith became harder, as it brought me closer to the core of my deepest fears\\nwithin. Yet each leap also became easier. I had tested my faith to the limit on\\nmany occasions previously and had gained wisdom and stronger faith in myself\\nthrough the process. Life also made more sense to me this way, regardless of\\nhow hard it was at times. I just didn’t fit in with the way conventional society\\nworks.\\n\\nIt was at that point, as I watched the high tide wash back out that I\\nremembered the importance of surrender, of letting go and allowing nature to\\nweave its magic. The same force that balances the flow of the tides, the force\\nthat sees seasons come and go perfectly, and creates life, was surely capable of\\nbringing the opportunity to me I needed. But I had to let go first. Trying to\\ncontrol the timing and outcome was a terrible waste of energy. My intentions\\nwere already out there and I had taken what action I could. My only job now was\\nto get out of the way.\\n\\nI laughed gently at myself remembering I had forgotten this. It was a lesson\\nfrom previous times. When I was out on the very end of a thin, flimsy, bending\\nlimb, the only thing to do was surrender and see where I landed. It was time to\\nlet go again.\\n\\nSurrender is not giving up, far from it. Surrender takes an enormous amount of\\ncourage. Often we are only capable of doing so when the pain of trying to\\ncontrol the outcome becomes too much to bear. Reaching that point is actually\\nliberating, even if it is not fun. Being able to accept there is absolutely nothing\\nmore you can do, other than hand it over to the greater force, is the catalyst that\\nfinally opens the flow.\\n\\nThe next morning I headed down the rocks to the water, where dolphins at\\nplay greeted me again at sunrise. I was feeling completely empty and drained\\nafter the onslaught of fear, pain, and resistance, finally leading to the surrender.\\nEmotional exhaustion had worn me out. But watching the dolphins, I absorbed\\nthe new dawn and slowly, gently, allowed myself to be refuelled by hope.\\n\\nIn casual conversation with some people on holidays in the caravan park a few\\ndays later, a job was offered to me in Melbourne, another seven or so hours\\nsouth. “Why not?” I thought. I was free to go anywhere and had wanted to live\\nin a cooler climate anyway. Melbourne soon became my favourite Australian\\ncity and remains so. But I hadn’t considered moving there at the time and had no\\nidea how much I would benefit from living in such a creative city. It was only\\nthrough surrendering and staying present that I could allow the job opportunity\\n\\x0cto flow my way.\\n\\nAs I finished telling my story to Stella, we both smiled. She ate her half a\\nstrawberry, agreeing without ego. She had been trying to control the moment of\\nher passing. It was time to surrender that control and as much as she didn’t\\nparticularly like the idea, she accepted it might still be some time before her day\\ncame. It takes the body nine months to form. Sometimes it takes a little while for\\nit to close down too.\\n\\nBy now though, she was very weak and almost off her food entirely. There\\nwas no energy to eat but she accepted small pieces of fruit simply to taste things.\\nThe day before, it had been two grapes. Today it was half a strawberry.\\n\\nHer illness should have seen her in a lot of pain, especially for how far along it\\nalready was, before she was diagnosed. But there was very little pain, which\\namazed her doctor. It was mostly exhaustion she experienced as it spread. All of\\nthe work she had done on her spiritual journey gave her a very strong connection\\nwith her body, now blessing her with being almost pain free. It was also what\\nallowed her a smooth departure when the time came.\\n\\nTwo or three days previously, I had noticed her fingers had swollen to the\\npoint that her wedding ring was now causing deep indentations in her finger. It\\nlooked like it was affecting the circulation there. Phoning my employer, I was\\nadvised by the nurse that the ring had to come off. With George lying on the bed\\nbeside her I worked on the finger with water and soap, gently removing it. It\\ntook so long to do and by then, both Stella and George were crying. I felt like the\\ndevil’s advocate, except that by the time I had succeeded in removing this\\nsymbol of their love that had been there for more than half a century, I was\\ncrying too.\\n\\nAlways such a dear man, George called her by a special, affectionate name\\nthat had been a part of their married life for so long. I left the room while they\\nshared a rare moment of private closeness, lying in each other’s arms for perhaps\\nthe last time ever. As I stood in the bathroom crying, I felt blessed to witness the\\ndepth of love that was between them. It was unlike any I had seen previously.\\nThey were true friends and both gentle, considerate people with everyone, and\\nespecially with each other. But it was still painful for me, watching them cry as\\nthe wedding ring was removed from Stella’s finger forever.\\n\\nTheir son and daughters visited regularly and were there a great deal more\\nnow, as time was drawing in. I liked them all. They were very different to each\\nother. But each of them was a decent and lovely person. One of the daughters in\\nparticular though, I had grown especially close to.\\n\\x0cA cool change came along unexpectedly one day and I found myself at work\\nwithout enough layers. George had insisted I put on one of Stella’s cardigans.\\nBoth he and Stella then agreed how much it suited me. It was one of those things\\nyou wouldn’t normally notice in the shop, as it wasn’t your style. But when you\\nput it on, you fell in love with it instantly. On this day the family, including\\nStella, gave me the cardigan to keep. Years later I still wear it. She had style, our\\nStella.\\n\\nThat night, she fell into a coma when I was at home sleeping. I returned the\\nnext morning to find a solemn house. George and their son David were there. As\\nthe soft breeze blew in through the bedroom door George laid on the bed beside\\nhis beautiful wife. His hand held hers, which was now getting cold. Stella was\\nstill alive but in these cases, as death gets closer, the circulation is affected in the\\nextremities. Her feet had also lost their warmth. David sat on a chair holding her\\nother hand. I sat on a chair further down the bed, my hand on her foot. I guess I\\njust needed to touch her too.\\n\\nAfter more than twelve hours of being in a deep coma, Stella opened her eyes\\nand smiled at something towards the ceiling. George sat up. “She’s smiling,” he\\ndeclared startled. “She’s smiling at something.”\\n\\nStella had no awareness of us anymore. But the smile she gave to whomever\\nor whatever she was looking at, cemented something in me that has never\\nwaivered. Having had meditations previously that took me to blissful places well\\nbeyond the usual human plane, I had never doubted an afterlife. But looking at\\nStella’s amazing happiness as she smiled to the ceiling with her eyes open, I\\nknew now with total conviction that nothing would ever sway me from this\\nbelief. There is something more to go to, or return to.\\n\\nAfter she smiled, Stella let out a small sigh, her eyes rolled back and all was\\nquiet. George and David looked to me for confirmation. Having only\\nexperienced Ruth’s passing before now I waited for the big breath, which was\\nnot forthcoming. “Is she dead? Is she dead?” they asked in despair and heart-\\nbroken sorrow.\\n\\nI tried to find the pulse in her neck but my own heart was beating so hard, I\\ncould only feel that rhythm. I was under immense pressure and had no idea what\\nI was doing. They looked at me desperately. I didn’t want to declare she had died\\nthen find her living for another day or two, or even just taking one more big\\nbreath. So I prayed for guidance.\\n\\nA calm came over me as I looked at her then and I knew she had left. It had\\nbeen such a smooth, graceful and gentle departure I hadn’t been able to tell. But\\n\\x0cthis wave of love now sweeping through me confirmed she had gone. I nodded,\\nand then George and David left the room immediately. The most heartbreaking\\nsob echoed through the house as George acknowledged his beloved wife was\\ngone. I sat in silence with Stella, as my own tears then also fell.\\n\\nA couple of hours later, with the rest of the family there and practical details\\nattended to, we said our goodbyes to each other. The morning had now warmed\\ninto a very hot day and I was contemplating what to do with myself, really just\\nwanting a superficial distraction. Still driving the same jeep from all of those\\nmiles travelled previously, I had to slam the driver’s door to get it closed\\nproperly. It had been this way for some time. As I did so this day, the whole\\ndriver’s seat window shattered and fell inside the door panels. I sat there staring\\nat it, already numb from the morming’s events and now even more shifted, due to\\nthe huge bang that came with the shattering. I looked out of the window, glass\\nfree except for a few fragments, and accepted that perhaps the best thing for me\\nwas just to go home.\\n\\nIt took three days for the replacement window to arrive. So I spent those days\\nat home and down by the harbour. I thanked Stella constantly during this time\\nfor sending me home. It was the best thing, allowing me to simply be. A couple\\nof months later I received a letter from Therese, the daughter of Stella’s I had\\ngrown close to. The day after Stella had passed, Therese was walking down the\\nstreet, naturally thinking of her mum. A huge white cockatoo flew right down in\\nfront of her, so close she could feel the wind from its wings. Stella was that sort\\nof woman, capable of sending us signs, and I delighted in reading Therese’s\\nletter.\\n\\nA year or so went by and I visited the family for dinner. I was looking very\\nforward to the night, especially to see darling George again and to see how he\\nwas getting on. Therese and her husband came along too. The evening started\\nout well and it was lovely to hear how George was becoming quite social,\\nplaying bridge and other things. Then somehow the dinner conversation ended\\nup back in the “lie” department. Therese was asking questions as to how\\ndifferent her mum’s passing had been to all of my previous clients, or something\\nalong those lines. That was my big chance to come clean and tell them how I had\\nbeen so inexperienced when caring for Stella.\\n\\nI really don’t think they would have minded by then, as they were more than\\nhappy in the service they had received. But I couldn’t come clean, as George was\\njust so delighted to have me there and kept making a point of how beautiful it\\nwas for us all to be together again. It took him back to Stella I am sure. I wanted\\n\\x0cto get Therese alone that night and tell her the full story, but no chance came up.\\n\\nWe lost touch soon after that night as life moved on. Some years later though,\\nwe all reconnected and I was given the chance to tell the family of my\\ninexperience, and of my regret in not being straight with them from the start.\\nThey were beautifully accepting and forgiving about it, saying I more than made\\nup for it with empathy and compassion. They had felt from the start I was the\\nright person to care for their mother, as had I. It was lovely to reconnect and\\nremember what we had all shared together. Every winter, I still wear my\\ncardigan and I think of Stella at times. Last winter I was wearing it as I re-read a\\nbook she had given me, pausing and smiling at my own memories. This work\\nsure introduced me to some beautiful people.\\n\\nBut either way, the lying thing was a great lesson. After my time with Stella, I\\ndecided I would never again lie to clients. The main thing was that I had learned\\nfrom it. I was an honest person and regardless of how difficult honesty may be to\\ndeliver, it was the only path I would ever walk comfortably.\\n\\nLearning from what happened then allowed me to forgive myself, and this, is\\nthe greatest forgiveness of all.\\n\\x0cREGRET 1:\\nI WISH ’D HAD THE COURAGE TO LIVE\\nA LIFE TRUE TO MYSELF, NOT THE\\nLIFE OTHERS EXPECTED OF ME\\n\\nefeKyod?\\n\\nIt took no time at all for Grace to become one of my favourite palliative clients.\\nShe was a tiny woman with a huge heart. This flowed on to her children; all of\\nwho were parents themselves by now, and equally beautiful people.\\n\\nGrace lived in a totally different part of the city, which was unusual for our\\nclients. It was a suburban street like many others with no mansions looming on\\neither side. My first impression was it would be a good street for a television\\nseries, as it oozed with family energy. The thing I most liked about Grace\\nherself, and her family, is they were very down to earth and genuinely\\nwelcoming.\\n\\nMy early days with her began as usually happened with clients, sharing stories\\nto get to know each other. Familiar comments were heard in the bathroom about\\nthe loss of dignity Grace was experiencing, with someone else having to wipe\\nher bum, and how a nice young thing like me shouldn’t have to do such an awful\\njob. I became used to that part of my work though and tried to lighten up the\\nsituation for Grace and for all of my clients by making no fuss of it. Being sick is\\ncertainly a way to dissolve the ego. Dignity disappears into the past forever\\nwhen you are terminally ill. Acceptance of the situation and of someone else\\nwiping your backside becomes inevitable, as clients become too sick to worry\\nabout such things after a while.\\n\\nMarried for more than fifty years, Grace had led the life expected of her. She\\nhad raised lovely children and now rejoiced in the lives of her grandchildren as\\nthey lived through their teenage years. Her husband had apparently been a bit of\\na tyrant though, making married life for Grace very unpleasant for decades. It\\nwas a relief for everyone, especially Grace, when he had been admitted into a\\nnursing home permanently only a few months before.\\n\\nGrace had spent her married life dreaming of living independently from her\\n\\n \\n\\x0chusband, of travelling, of not living under his dictatorship and mostly, just of\\nliving a simple, happy life. Although she was in her eighties, she had still been\\nfit for her age and healthy. Good health gives freedom of mobility and this had\\nbeen present for her when he was admitted into the nursing home.\\n\\nWithin a short time of her newly found and long awaited freedom however,\\nGrace began to feel very ill. A few days after this turning point, she was\\ndiagnosed with terminal illness, already quite advanced. What made this even\\nmore heartbreaking was that her illness was due to her husband’s long-term\\nsmoking habit within the home. The illness was aggressive and by the time a\\nmonth had passed, Grace had lost all of her strength and was bedridden, other\\nthan hobbling slowly to the bathroom with a walking frame while assisted.\\nDreams she had waited all of her life to live were now never going to happen. It\\nwas too late. The anguish she suffered over this was ongoing and tormented her\\nenormously.\\n\\n“Why didn’t I just do what I wanted? Why did I let him rule me? Why wasn’t\\nI strong enough?” were questions I heard regularly. She was so angry with\\nherself for not having found the courage. Her children confirmed the hard life\\nshe had experienced and their hearts felt for her, as did mine.\\n\\n“Don’t you ever let anyone stop you doing what you want Bronnie,” she said.\\n“Promise that to this dying woman please.” I promised and went on to explain\\nhow I was fortunate to have an amazing mother who had taught me\\nindependence by example.\\n\\n“Look at me now,” Grace continued. “Dying. Dying! How can it be possible I\\nhave waited all of these years to be free and independent and now it is too late?”\\nThere was no denying this was a tragic situation and one that was going to be a\\nconstant reminder to live my own way.\\n\\nIn her bedroom, dotted with sentimental artifacts and photos of her family, we\\nshared hours of conversations over those first weeks. Her decline was happening\\nquite fast though. Grace explained that she wasn’t against marriage, not at all.\\nShe thought it could be a beautiful thing and a great opportunity to grow,\\nthrough shared learning. What she was against was the doctrine of her\\ngeneration, stating that you had to stay in a marriage regardless of anything. And\\nso she had, all the while forfeiting her own happiness. She had dedicated her life\\nto her husband who took her love completely for granted.\\n\\nNow that she was dying, she didn’t care what people thought of her and\\nanguished over why she hadn’t worked this out sooner. Grace had kept up\\nappearances and lived the way others expected her to, only now realising the\\n\\x0cchoice to do so had always been her own and was based on fear. Although I\\noffered support, including the need to forgive herself, the fact that it was all now\\ntoo late, continued to overwhelm her.\\n\\nMost of my assignments were of this one-on-one kind, longer-term clients\\nwho I would care for until they passed. There came to be many others dotted in\\nbetween these though over the years, clients who I would see just a few times in\\nbetween their own regular carers. These words from Grace, filled with anguish,\\ndespair and frustration, became familiar words from many others I also came to\\nmeet. Of all of the regrets and lessons shared with me as I sat beside their beds,\\nthe regret of not having lived a life true to themselves was the most common one\\nof all. It was also the one that caused the most frustration, as the client’s\\nrealisation came too late.\\n\\n“Tt’s not like I wanted to live a grand life,” Grace explained in one of many\\nconversations from her bed. “I am a good person and I didn’t wish to harm\\nanyone.” Grace was one of the sweetest people I have ever met and wouldn’t\\nhave been capable of harming anyone anyway. It just wasn’t in her. “But I\\nwanted to do things for me too and I just didn’t have the courage.”\\n\\nGrace now understood it would have been better for everyone had she been\\nbrave enough to honour this desire. “Well, everyone except for my husband,” she\\nsaid with disgust towards herself. “I would have been happier and would not\\nhave let this misery permeate our family for decades. Why did I put up with\\nhim? Why Bronnie, why?” Her heartbreaking sobs burst out and continued to\\nflow as I held the dear lady close.\\n\\nWhen her tears subsided, she looked at me with fierce determination. “I mean\\nit. Promise this dying woman that you will always be true to yourself, that you\\nwill be brave enough to live the way you want to, regardless of what other\\npeople say.” The lace curtains blew softly, allowing the day outside to enter the\\nbedroom, as we looked at each other with love, clarity, and determination.\\n\\n“TI promise Grace. I am already trying to. But I promise you now that I will\\nalways continue to do so,” I replied with heartfelt truth. Holding my hand, she\\nsmiled knowing that at least her learning wasn’t going to be totally wasted.\\nExplaining to Grace that for over a decade of my adult life I had worked in those\\nunsatisfying banking, administration and management roles, she started to\\nunderstand me more and listened with great interest. Further years in banking\\nhad been added to this tally later, when I had returned from overseas. But I\\ncalled those my weaning years, weaning myself out of the industry.\\n\\nThe first couple of years out of school were fun. There were many trainees and\\n\\x0cwork was a social thing above all else. All of the trainees were seventeen or\\neighteen years old. So work was really just about catching up with friends and\\nearning money to fund our weekends. The work itself was very easy for me at\\nfirst and may have stayed that way, if my heart had been in the job. It never was\\nthough. After those first years, I quickly became restless and began questioning\\nlife. Yet I carried on with the life expected of me for a decade more, the whole\\ntime knowing there was something else waiting but not having the courage to\\nseek it.\\n\\nWhat kept me there most was the fear of ridicule I would face from some\\nfamily members, if I broke out of the mould they expected me to fit. I was living\\nsomeone else’s life through my shoes and it was never going to work. Yet I\\ncarried on, changing bank jobs, uniforms, and locations regularly. As a result, I\\nfound myself on an accelerated career path, due to having worked for most of\\nthe banks and in more roles than a normal person my age would have. I was a\\nsuccess by default.\\n\\nDesperately unhappy, I continued to give my working week to an industry that\\ndid nothing for my soul. There are plenty of people who love their jobs in\\nbanking and I am happy for them. Banking needs such people. These days too\\nthere are opportunities to work in areas where you are giving back to the\\ncommunity and other noble avenues. But like Grace, I had been living the life\\nothers expected of me, not the life I wanted to.\\n\\nAs I could do no right with some of my family and was struggling to be who\\nthey wanted me to be, staying in a ‘good job’ would at least keep them off my\\nback in that area of my life. I was trapped with fear and the potential pain that\\nwould be created by setting myself up for even more judgment than I had\\nalready endured.\\n\\nBeing the black sheep in any family is never an easy task. Black sheep have a\\ndifferent role to play in family dynamics. But it is not always easy. When some\\nof the main players in the unit gain their power by reducing the strength of\\nothers, it is a hard road upwards. But working amongst so many families in this\\nline of work, I came to observe that very few families are free of conflict on\\nsome level. Every family has its learning, every one of them. Mine was no\\ndifferent, though this realisation didn’t necessarily ease my own pain at the time.\\n\\nMaking jokes of me had been a family sport for as long as I could remember. I\\nwas a swimmer amongst a family of horse riders, a vegetarian from a sheep\\nfarming family, a nomad in a family of settlers, and on it went. Often things said\\nwere in jest and the person saying so may not have realised the pain they were\\n\\x0ccausing at the time. But jokes tend to wear thin after a few decades of hearing\\nthem. At other times though, too often, things said were intentional and just\\noutright cruel. Even if you had the strength of a thousand people, it does wear\\nyou down after years. Particularly when you have trouble even recalling a period\\nof your life when being ridiculed, yelled at, or told you were hopeless, were not\\na part of it.\\n\\nConsequently, up until this time I had never particularly enjoyed family\\ndynamics. So the easiest way to handle this back then was just to keep living the\\nlife expected of me. Eventually though, I did begin to withdraw and close down\\naround them. It was my own coping mechanism.\\n\\nArtists the world over are also a misunderstood lot, and I was an artist. I just\\nhadn’t realised it yet. All I knew was that selling insurance products to people\\njust wanting to bank their pay cheques was really not up my alley. The branch\\nsales at the end of the month held absolutely no relevance to me. I didn’t care\\nabout anything except giving the customers friendly, warm service, which I did\\nvery well. But that was not enough in the changing face of the banking industry.\\nIt was all sell, sell, sell.\\n\\nThey say though that we do more to avoid pain than we do to gain pleasure.\\nSo it is when the pain becomes too much that we finally find the courage to\\nmake changes. Until then, the pain within me was just continuing to fester until\\nit did reach breaking point.\\n\\nWhen I left yet another ‘good job’ to go and live on the island, confusion\\nreigned. ‘Why would she do that? Where is she going to this time?’ And through\\nall of this I was just thinking with excitement, ‘I’m going to live on an island!’\\nThe further away, the happier I was. My life was my own there and it was a good\\nlife. Any contact I did have with the mainland was to my dear mother, who was\\nmy rock and treasured friend.\\n\\nIt was during these years on the island that I first dabbled in meditation. Later\\nI found my way to the path that would offer me the opportunity to connect with\\nmy own goodness in ways no other had. Through this path, I began to\\nunderstand and experience compassion. It is such a beautiful and powerful force.\\n\\nThe pain I had accepted from others had been their own suffering projected\\nonto me. Happy people do not treat other people that way. They don’t judge\\nothers for living a life true to his or her self. If anything, they respect it.\\nRecognising the pain carried into my generation from previous ones, I had the\\nchoice to break free of it in my own life. I was never going to be able to control\\nanother and had no desire to. People change because they want to and when they\\n\\x0care ready.\\n\\nLearning to view life compassionately, and accept that I may never have the\\nunderstanding or loving relationships I had once yearned for, was liberating. It\\ntransformed my life on so many levels. Knowing the ongoing pain of my own\\nhealing, I accepted that not everyone has the courage to face his or her past, at\\nleast not until it becomes unbearable.\\n\\nTo a degree, the same dynamics persisted for some years after, but began to\\naffect me less and less. It took strength and time, but I now saw that it was not\\nabout me. It was about whichever person was trying to give me their criticism or\\njudgment.\\n\\nA Buddhist story is that a man came shouting angrily at Buddha, who\\nremained unaffected by him. When questioned by others as to how he remained\\ncalm and unaffected, Buddha answered with a question. “If someone gives you a\\ngift and you choose not to receive it, to whom then does the gift belong?” Of\\ncourse it stays with the giver. So it was with words that were still unjustly\\ndumped onto me sometimes. I stopped taking them on and instead I felt\\ncompassion. After all, those words were not coming from a place of happiness.\\n\\nThe most important thing I have ever learnt in life though, the most, most\\nimportant thing, is that compassion starts with yourself. Developing compassion\\nfor others allowed the healing to begin and continue. It removed me from the\\nequation somewhat when the old behavioural patterns still tried to reign. I could\\nrecognise the suffering and see it wasn’t about me at all. It was someone else’s\\nown pain coming up and out. This didn’t just apply to family relationships of\\ncourse. It was relevant to all relationships, personal, public, and professional. We\\nall suffer at some time. We all have pain, every one of us.\\n\\nBut learning how to develop compassion for myself was much harder and\\nthough I didn’t know at the time, it was going to take years. We are all so hard\\non ourselves, unfairly so. Learning to give myself loving kindness and\\nacknowledge that I too had suffered enormously was such a difficult change to\\nmake. It was almost easier to listen to unfair opinions from others and take them\\non, as it was so familiar. It may not have brought happiness, but learning to be\\nkind to myself and give myself compassion above everything else, was certainly\\na process I had to grow into. But the healing had at least now begun.\\n\\nWith this new intention of self-love, self-respect and self-compassion, the old\\nfamily dynamics started losing power. I found the strength to speak back,\\nallowing myself to finally be heard, rather than continuing to withdraw. Of\\ncourse, this was my own pain now being expressed and not really about the\\n\\x0cpeople I addressed at all. We all interpret things that happen to us in our own\\nway. So it was about me expressing and releasing my own suffering. Breaking\\nthe patterns of decades took a lot of guts. But my pain gave me that and I had\\nnothing to lose anymore. As it was, I just couldn’t carry the pain of silence any\\nlonger.\\n\\nIn the end though, it was really only the desire to be loved, accepted, and\\nunderstood by each other that was truly fuelling the pain in us all. So\\ncompassion was the only way forward: compassion and patience. In spite of\\neverything, love, in its own fragile disguise, still existed between us.\\n\\nIt was as if I had been swimming down the same river over and over, and each\\ntime, I would come across a large rock blocking my natural flow. It was always\\nthere. One day though, I realised that it may always be there. So rather than have\\nto face that same rock, that same blockage repeatedly, I was choosing\\nsomewhere different to swim, somewhere that would allow me to move forward\\nfreely and naturally. I didn’t have to set myself up for that hurdle over and over,\\none that hindered my natural progress, causing blockages and pain every time\\nwithout fail.\\n\\nIt was time to do things differently. It was time to choose a different way, to\\nspeak up and say ‘enough’. I wasn’t willing to tolerate the same patterns\\nanymore. Even if it turned out lonelier, at least it may lead to peace. The other\\npath certainly wasn’t peaceful.\\n\\nAfter speaking up, things started to change within myself. I grew stronger in\\nself-respect and clearer in self-expression. Some new and healthier seeds had\\nfinally been sown. I didn’t yet know how to nurture them, but they were planted\\nat least. It was time to start living as who I wanted to be, one small step at a time.\\n\\nAfter sharing all of this with Grace, we grew closer without effort. She agreed\\nthat all families have their learning. She couldn’t think of one family that hadn’t\\nhad its challenges and believed that families bring the greatest gifts of learning\\nfor most people. We discussed how the only way to experience love is to accept\\npeople totally as who they are and have no expectations of them. While it may\\nbe much easier said than done, it was the most loving approach possible.\\n\\nGrace shared many stories with me; reflecting on her life, of the children\\ngrowing up, the neighbourhood changing, then often back to her dying regret.\\nShe wished she’d had the courage to live a life true to her own heart, not the life\\nothers expected of her. When there is limited time left, there is little to lose by\\nbeing totally honest. What we shared with each other now was straight to the\\ncore of important things. There was no idle chatter anymore as all of the subjects\\n\\x0ccovered were deeply personal. Opening up to Grace was unexpectedly very\\nhealing for me and my listening ear became healing for her.\\n\\nEventually we also came onto the subject of where my life was now, my\\nmusical directions, and how I had started to write songs and perform. Over a cup\\nof tea, Grace insisted I bring my guitar to work the next day and play her\\nsomething, which was an absolute pleasure for me. With a heart of happiness, I\\nsang to Grace as she smiled and hummed, sitting up in her bed. She embraced\\nevery song I shared, receiving them as if each one was the best song in the\\nworld. Her family too came to hear some of them and was equally beautiful and\\nsupportive. One song in particular Grace absolutely loved, as she had always\\nwanted to travel. It was called ‘Beneath Australian Skies’.\\n\\nAfter that day, she would ask me to sing to her regularly. There was no need\\nfor a guitar Grace had said. So I’d sit there in her bedroom, singing to this\\ndelightful little lady, as she closed her eyes smiling, absorbing everything I sang.\\nSongs were requested over and over and I never tired of singing them to her.\\n\\nEach day Grace’s health deteriorated. Her tiny size reduced even more. Old\\nfriends came to say their goodbyes. Relatives sat by her bed chatting and\\nfighting back their tears. Her family was a hands-on one, very involved, and\\ntheir visits regular. I liked that. There was also gentleness in them that I was\\ndrawn to. When they were all gone though, it was just Grace and I again and the\\nrequest for more singing resurfaced. They were special times.\\n\\nShe was not able to walk well now and though Grace had accepted the use of\\nthe commode by the bed, she refused when it came to her bowel movements.\\nShe wanted to use a proper toilet so I didn’t have to clean the commode. There\\nwas no budging her on this, even when I tried to assure Grace it was no big deal\\nfor me to do. So ages passed as we made our way to the bathroom, which\\nthankfully was next to her bedroom. She was very weak. When the business was\\ndone and she was clean, I assisted her with standing up then pulled her\\nunderpants back up. Balancing her while doing the undies thing had to be quite a\\nswift move.\\n\\nAs we then started our hike back to the bedroom, Grace leaning on her\\nwalking frame and me following, holding her hips, I noticed that in the rush I\\nhad tucked a little of her nightdress into the back of her underpants. Smiling at\\nthis dear littke woman in her last days, tottering back to bed, I was then\\noverwhelmed with joy as she started to sing ‘Beneath Australian Skies’ as she\\nwalked. A few of the words were in the wrong places, but that just made the\\nmoment even more endearing.\\n\\x0cI knew then that I had just experienced the high point of my musical career.\\nNothing that could ever happen again would ever top the joy I experienced at\\nthat moment. If I never wrote another song it would not have bothered me. To\\nhave brought this dear person so much pleasure through my music, and to then\\nreceive that pleasure back by hearing her singing my song in her final days,\\nopened my heart more than anything I had ever hoped for musically.\\n\\nArriving at work a couple of days later, it was obvious that today was to be the\\nlast for Grace. Explaining that I was going to call her family, she initially shook\\nher head no. Weak and exhausted, she reached up and hugged me. To save her\\nlittle arms the effort, I lay on the bed and held her in my own. She liked that and\\nwe lay talking softly for a while, as her fingers stroked my arm. Asking why she\\ndidn’t want the family there, she said she didn’t want to cause them any more\\npain. She loved them too much.\\n\\nBut they needed to say goodbye, I said, and not giving them that choice may\\nend up causing them both pain and guilt that they would have to live with. She\\nunderstood and agreed, accepting that she didn’t want them to feel guilty for not\\nbeing there. So phone calls were made and the family soon arrived. But just\\nbefore they did, she said to me through her exhaustion, “You remember our\\npromise Bronnie, don’t you?”\\n\\nNodding through my tears I said “Yes”.\\n\\n“Live true to your own heart. Don’t ever worry what others think. Promise me\\nBronnie,” her voice now a barely audible whisper.\\n\\n“I promise you Grace,” I said gently. Squeezing my hand she drifted off to\\nsleep, waking again only for brief moments to acknowledge her lovely family\\nwho then sat by her bedside until the end. Within a few hours, Grace drifted off.\\nHer time had come. Sitting quietly in the kitchen afterwards, my promise to her\\nwas still fresh in my ears. But it was not just Grace I had made the promise to. It\\nwas also to myself.\\n\\nStanding on stage launching my album a few months later, I dedicated that\\nsong to her. Grace’s family was in the audience. The spotlight blacked out most\\nof the faces but I didn’t need to see them. I could feel the love they were sharing\\nas I remembered that dear little woman who hadn’t lived as she wanted, but who\\nhad inspired me to instead.\\n\\x0cPRODUCTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT\\neter\\n\\nAnthony was only in his late thirties when we first met one Saturday afternoon.\\nHe had dark-blonde curly hair and despite being ill, had a natural look of\\nmischief about him. It was a big change for me to be caring for someone\\nyounger. Striking up a friendship was a breeze and despite the circumstances, we\\nenjoyed an element of humour from the start.\\n\\nWith a younger brother, four younger sisters, and a high profile family in the\\nbusiness world, he had been very indulged throughout his life. Whatever\\nAnthony wanted was his and he used it to his advantage as a younger man. But\\nhe also had big shoes to fill due to the financial success of his family. This\\npressure worked in reverse and despite intelligence and opportunities, he had\\nvery low self-esteem. He masked this quite well beneath his humour and\\nmischief. Anthony could not be what his family wanted him to be and as the\\noldest son in the family, this created a lot of pressure within him.\\n\\nHis years as a young adult were spent driving fast cars, being chased by\\npolice, hiring the most expensive working girls, and causing havoc to anyone\\nwho crossed his path. This was territorial land between the young men of the\\nwealthy suburbs. Some of the actions Anthony had employed in his past were\\nhardly endearing. But due to being a man of little self worth, he also lived quite\\nrecklessly, challenging life to some dangerous levels. One such act left him in\\nhospital with damaged organs and limbs, with the potential of losing his health\\nforever, and the freedom that comes from such health.\\n\\nThe doctors were doing what they could to return his freedom to him but\\nthings were not looking hopeful. Anthony was pretty resigned to it though.\\nAlready realising he had probably done some permanent damage, he asked the\\ndoctors for the next operation to go ahead as soon as possible, so he could know\\neither way. A couple of surgical procedures were done. Then painkillers kept\\nhim sleeping for the first week or so, as I sat beside his bed in the hospital room.\\nAfter that it was a case of wait and see, hopefully allowing for a gradual\\nrecovery.\\n\\nWe fell into the habit of me reading to him. It started one evening when he\\nasked me what I was reading. After spending that time living in the Middle East\\n\\x0cpreviously, I wanted to spend more time there. The book I was reading was an\\nintelligent, unbiased look at the way of life in that region and the history. While I\\nwas not in denial about the subjugation of women in some of these countries, or\\nthe extent that some of the extremists from these nations go to in the name of\\nreligion (just as extremists from any religion lose sight of the teachings of\\nkindness that are common in all religions), I had also seen a side of this culture\\nthat is unfortunately never portrayed in the media.\\n\\nThese warm-hearted people were wonderfully family orientated, and some of\\nthe most hospitable hosts that I had come across. Beautiful hearts were opened\\nand they welcomed me without hesitation. This has also been the same with\\npeople from that region I have since come to know in Australia. We have lost so\\nmuch of the family connection in the West, particularly where the older\\ngeneration is concerned. I was seeing this first hand by the amount of lonely\\npeople in nursing homes, during the random shifts I sometimes had to do in\\nthem.\\n\\nOther cultures and how differently we all choose to live fascinate me. So do\\nthe culinary delights to be discovered through other cultures. Yet we are all very\\nmuch alike in other ways too. Racism is something I will never understand. The\\nmajority of us are the same, in that we just want to be happy. And on some level,\\nwe all have hearts that suffer.\\n\\nAnthony was keen to hear more of what I was learning. So after making us a\\npot of herbal tea, its aroma wafting gently through the room, I brought him up to\\ndate on the book so far. The reading then continued, but now out loud. We would\\nshare an hour or two like this every day and it became a time we both enjoyed.\\nBecause we had quite a few weeks of this, I was able to introduce Anthony to\\nbooks he would have never come across otherwise. Offering him a choice of\\ntopics, he always insisted he would be happy with whatever I read.\\n\\nSo I introduced some spiritual classics to him. Books came to be shared about\\nlife, philosophy and thinking outside of the square. Discussion would flow on\\nnaturally afterwards as I tended to his needs; lifting up an arm that was not\\nworking, another in a plaster cast, dressing the wound on a leg that was not\\nworking, then feeding him, combing his hair, and attending to other personal\\ngrooming needs.\\n\\nIn the end though, the physical damage resulting from his actions meant the\\noperations were not wholly successful. Some things were fixed. But some parts\\nof him were damaged for life. So he was unable to go home, due to life ahead\\nnow requiring assistance with permanent personal care. It was then decided he\\n\\x0cwould go into a nursing home, one of the best in the city, at least according to the\\nbrochure and the price.\\n\\nAnthony was a young man now surrounded by drab coloured walls, and dying,\\nelderly people. It was an awful environment and I longed to take to the walls\\nwith brighter coloured paint. Initially, he was happy enough though. It brought\\nhim peace that the pressure had been lifted from his family, as they knew he was\\nbeing cared for. He was also able to bring good cheer to the older residents and\\nthey loved him. Over time though, his light grew dull and the shortage of outside\\nstimulus numbed his intelligence from lack of use. He started to become a\\nproduct of his environment.\\n\\nWe are all fairly malleable, bendable creatures really. While we have the\\nchoice to think for ourselves and have free will to live the way our hearts guide\\nus, our environment has a huge effect on us all, particularly until we start\\nchoosing life from a more conscious perspective.\\n\\nAnother example of being influenced by the surrounding environment is\\nwatching down-to-earth and already happy people get caught up in the chase for\\nmore, more, more after a job promotion. The desire to keep up with new friends\\non the new level of income often sees people change within to suit their\\nenvironment. The area they were once happy living in is no longer good enough,\\nso they move to somewhere more suitable, for example. Sometimes this will\\nbring happiness, sure, but not always.\\n\\nMany country people also adapt to city life and become affected by city\\nfashions and busier lifestyles. Not that there isn’t fashion in the country. There\\ndefinitely is. But again, it is a case of being influenced by where you live. Some\\npeople raised in cities also adapt to country life and slow their lifestyles down,\\nditching their labels and finding happiness in jeans and gumboots, as they plod\\naround on their acreage. Wherever we are, our environment influences us\\nenormously if we hang around long enough.\\n\\nDuring my mid twenties I was having a lot of fun. The start of that decade had\\nbeen hard for me. By the time I was nineteen years old I was engaged to be\\nmarried, and had a serious life complete with mortgage commitments. It was an\\nunhealthy relationship for the most part. Somehow I survived that time though.\\nLooking back, I have no idea how. An excess of mental abuse, psychological\\ngames, and being exposed to various states of rage expressed by my partner,\\ncontinuously diminished my confidence.\\n\\nIt all became too much around the same time as I scored a new job, not\\nsurprisingly, in a bank. The team at work was fantastic and I found myself\\n\\x0cstarting to enjoy life again. Having steady work also allowed me to dream of a\\nlife beyond my current situation and I moved out. Before too long, I transferred\\nto the north coast with my job, for a fresh start.\\n\\nIn no time at all dancing and frivolity were given free license and became a\\nhappy, carefree part of my life. There were also a lot of drugs around me. By\\nnow I knew drinking wasn’t for me and although I hadn’t yet reached the point\\nwhere I would give up alcohol forever, drinking was not a big part of my life.\\nThere was plenty of other stuff on offer though and within a year I experimented\\nwith most of it. These were the days before synthetic drugs like ice and others I\\ndon’t even know the street names of. Homegrown pot was common in my circle\\nof friends and when another friend gave me the opportunity to try opium, I did.\\n\\nI was in a space where I felt I could try new things but was clear enough in\\nmyself to let most of it go after one experience, though I never tempted that\\ntheory with heroin, thank goodness. I never went near it. Thankfully only one\\nexperiment was the case with opium, magic mushrooms, LSD, and cocaine, all\\nof which I tried within that twelve month period but never again. There was a\\nneed in me for some recklessness I think, after the confines of my upbringing\\nand the previous relationship. But underneath all of this, on an unconscious\\nlevel, was a total lack of self worth that had become a part of me and was still\\nbeing nurtured.\\n\\nThe life of excessive drug indulgence wasn’t for me though. I knew that\\nimmediately and while I was happy to try some things, I told myself it was more\\nout of a desire to experience life than the need to be ‘off my face’. Consciously,\\nit didn’t take me long to work out I preferred a healthier life. Unconsciously\\nthough, there was still so much to be undone after decades of allowing the\\nopinions of others to dominate my belief system. Happiness was still very\\ndependent on external forces.\\n\\nA few years afterwards, following the island stint too, I was living in England\\npulling beers in the village pub. Speed was around a lot. After doing a couple of\\nlines, the local lads would come into the pub with huge dilated pupils, whilst\\ngrinding their teeth all night. Their regular routines were the same year in, year\\nout. So when someone scored speed, it altered their realities enough to give them\\na different view of the same scene. It was merely boredom they were trying to\\nescape from and watching them on the days after, with the melancholy and\\nexhaustion that followed, I had to wonder if the price was worth it.\\n\\nThere were a few occasions where my partner and I decided to join in. But it\\ndidn’t take us long to realise it wasn’t our thing. The comedown from speed was\\n\\x0cawful and I hated myself for doing this to my body. Yet about a month or so\\nlater, I found myself experiencing a life changing time, again being influenced\\nby my environment and the lack of will and conscious choice to live a better life.\\n\\nDean was working all weekend, so I joined the ranks of the other village lads\\nand jumped on a train up to London for the night. Despite being in my late-\\ntwenties, I had never been to a rave, simply because they didn’t play my sort of\\nmusic. But rather than see me at home on my own, the lads convinced me to join\\nthem, promising me the time of my life. They were all my mates so off I went.\\n\\nA previous experience on ecstasy, the only occasion I had tried it, had been\\nOK. Id had a silly night and survived the come down, although definitely not\\nenjoyably. My stomach felt awful and my energy was incredibly low for days. It\\nhad felt like enough of an experience though, and I had declined any offers of it\\nsince. I also lived with self-loathing afterwards and I could do without any more\\nof that. There were enough of those thoughts in me already. Yet here I was on the\\ntrain to London with eight guys convincing me to have an ecstasy pill.\\n\\nThose in the city scene were dropping several pills every week, so what was\\nthe big deal about me having one little one? I don’t blame the guys at all though,\\nnot in the slightest. They enjoyed that stuff and were only trying to get me to join\\nthem. The final choice was ultimately mine as the pill slid down my throat, just\\nas the train pulled into Victoria station. It was the middle of winter and\\nabsolutely freezing outside, as London is at that time of year.\\n\\nFrom the moment we walked into the club, I hated the music and wanted the\\nnight to be over. Acoustic music was always going to be my thing, much more\\nthan anything digital, though each to their own of course. Techno music blared\\nout through the speakers. Making a conscious choice to stop judging the\\nsituation and accept I was there until sunrise, I loosened up and joined the lads\\non the dance floor. While they were having a blast immediately, I was merely\\nenduring it.\\n\\nThen the pill kicked in with full intensity and I knew I had to get out of the\\ncrowd. Sweat poured off me. Every bump of anyone’s body on the dance floor\\nmade me claustrophobic. I stumbled around trying to find some space. The bass\\nthumped through the floorboards and through my body. Smiling faces from the\\nlads who were dancing nearby blurred into somewhere else. I was losing control\\nfast and I had to get to a safe place.\\n\\nNoise, laughing faces, and lighting were increasingly distorted as I made my\\nway in a desperate haze to the women’s toilets. I couldn’t keep a cubicle all to\\nmyself for the whole night, as much as I wanted to. After contemplating this for\\n\\x0csome time while in the cubicle, I reluctantly surrendered the private space when\\ngirls started knocking on the door to see if anyone was in there.\\n\\nIt was too cold to go outside of the club and the first train home wasn’t until\\nsix am. The noise of the ladies toilets and the laughter of people coming and\\ngoing left me in a swirling daze. Then I spotted the window ledge. My haven, I\\ndecided. Climbing onto the sink I managed my way onto the ledge, which was\\nplenty wide enough for me to sit on without any risk of slipping off. Sliding\\nacross, I found a nice little corner out of the way, overlooking the sinks in the\\nladies room. Busyness and chaos were below. But I could now rest my back and\\nhead against the window and try to find some peace.\\n\\nSweat continued to pour from me. The icy window I was leaning against\\nbrought much-needed reprieve. I was in my own world now and could possibly\\nhandle things better. My poor heart was beating faster than could ever be natural\\nfor a human heart and I prayed it would survive the night. It didn’t slow down.\\nYet it didn’t cross my mind to ask for medical help either. Maybe it was a\\nsubconscious fear of the law and illegal drugs. I don’t know. But sitting with my\\nhead resting back against that icy cold window was what I felt I most needed.\\n\\n“Are you alright, love?” an English girl asked me, tugging at the hem of my\\njeans, which were at eye level to her.\\n\\nI vaguely heard her but sat open mouthed, head resting back, staring at the\\nceiling. It was just too hard to answer. My heartbeat was out of control and I\\ncouldn’t move.\\n\\n“Love, are you alright?” she persisted. With every ounce of effort I could\\nmuster, I looked down at her and nodded.\\n\\n“Do you have any water?” she asked. I shrugged my shoulders to which she\\ndisappeared, only to return with a bottle of water for me. “Drink this,” she\\ninsisted. Obliging, I then watched her re-fill the bottle from the bathroom tap.\\n\\n“Thanks,” I managed to say with a slight smile. The conversation was good\\nfor me, as difficult as it was. I had to concentrate rather than be lost in the trip\\nmy mind and body were taking. We managed to chat for a while. She was an\\nangel.\\n\\nThroughout the whole night I remained on that window ledge, unable to move,\\nmy heart still pounding out of my chest, the freezing night air on the window\\nbehind me balancing the excess heat within my body. That beautiful woman\\ncontinued to come in regularly and check on me, topping up my water bottle and\\nchatting with me each time. I don’t know who she was to this day, but I hate to\\nthink what would have happened to me without her.\\n\\x0cAbout half an hour before the club shut, she helped me down. I was still\\nterribly off my head and not enjoying it one bit, but I could speak more clearly\\nnow. We managed to smile and chat a little. But even though we made slight jest\\nof it, we both knew the seriousness of what I had been through and I hugged her\\nin thanks. She then led me back out into the club to find the lads. They had been\\nlooking for me for half the night and were frightfully relieved to see me. “Keep\\nan eye on her,” the woman told them, handing one of them my hand and saying\\ngoodbye to me with a kiss and a smile.\\n\\nOn the train home, the lads couldn’t stop laughing with each other and talking\\nabout what a fantastic night it had been, wishing they were still there and sorry\\nthe drugs had worn off. I lent my head against the window and feigned sleep,\\nknowing it would be some time before that was truly possible. My heart was still\\nbeating out through my chest and my only thought was that I wished it would all\\njust wear off.\\n\\nThe days of messing my precious body up with toxic chemicals were behind\\nme from that day onward. Sleeping for two solid days afterwards, I awoke as a\\nnew woman grateful for the huge lesson I had been given. Lying there looking at\\nthe ceiling, exhausted from the ride my poor body had been through, my biggest\\nrelief was that I had survived it. It was time to treat myself with more respect\\nand look after the gift of health I had been given.\\n\\nSeveral years later I was offered an ecstasy pill at a gig, which I declined\\npolitely without hesitation. It felt so foreign to my world by then. I realised I had\\nagain grown into a product of my environment, thankfully, my new environment.\\nMy lifestyle had become one of health. Social times with friends were spent over\\nhealthy food, drinking tea around fires, long walks, and swimming in rivers. It\\nwas an environment that suited me much better. I didn’t mind at all being a\\nproduct of this environment.\\n\\nAnthony though had become a product of his environment in the worst\\npossible way. During my visits over his first year in the home, he would love to\\ndiscuss current affairs from the radio or television. He was astute and always\\nready to offer an intelligent opinion or a bit of cheek. He also encouraged me to\\nshare stories with him, as to what was happening in my own life and was\\ngenuinely interested.\\n\\nOver time though, his light faded to the point that he would even decline me\\ntaking him outside. Previously we’d had delightful times, soaking up the\\nsunshine and talking to passers-by. Sometimes we would just sit in the garden of\\nthe home, watching the birds and catching up with each other that way. Either\\n\\x0cway, they were always fun times with lots of laughter and conversation.\\n\\nIf any one of his friends or family suggested he try to learn new skills and\\ncreate a better life than his current one, he would shut off from listening. “I don’t\\nsee the point,” he said to me time and again. “Things are fine here, I accept this\\nlot in life.” Anthony felt he deserved what had happened to him due to the harm\\nhe had done to others in the past.\\n\\n“You’ve paid your dues Anthony,” I would say. “You’ve learnt from it and\\nthat’s what matters.” But he wouldn’t forgive himself. Also, he couldn’t be\\nbothered creating a better life. Anthony had slowed down to the pace and routine\\nof the nursing home and had no aspirations to return to regular life in society\\nagain. His disabilities somehow gave him a sense of relief in a way, as if he\\ndidn’t have to try anymore. This was despite plenty of people with various\\ndisabilities living full and inspiring lives elsewhere. But most of all with these\\nexcuses, he couldn’t set himself up to fail. When questioned, he admitted to me\\nhe didn’t have the courage to try anymore. If he didn’t try, he couldn’t fail. Not\\none ounce of motivation remained in him and as the sun rose and set each day,\\nAnthony chose to sleep his life away instead.\\n\\nI continued to visit him occasionally for another year or so, as oppressive as\\nhis environment was. But one-sided friendships are exhausting for anyone and\\nthis is what it was becoming. Anthony had lost the motivation to phone anyone,\\nincluding me, as he always used to in between visits. When I did see him, our\\nconversations now revolved around how well his bowels were working and how\\nrude the employees were. His lack of interest in his appearance too was\\nimpossible to ignore.\\n\\nAnthony had grown old before his time and while he was still at least thirty\\nyears younger than most of the other residents, he now fit right in. He was a\\nproduct of his environment. Watching this lovely man’s light fade offered\\nanother reminder about how important having courage is, in order to live the life\\nyour heart desires. Sadly, his life was an example of what I didn’t want.\\n\\nA phone call from his younger brother a few years later told me Anthony had\\npassed away. Until then, his life had not changed at all and he had continued to\\nrefuse any outings from the home, including family gatherings. Anthony said he\\njust couldn’t be bothered, his brother told me. I couldn’t help but wonder what\\nhis final thoughts were when he was lying there looking back over his life.\\n\\nThe impact of Anthony’s sense of failure drove me forward. With a total lack\\nof effort, Anthony had given himself absolutely no opportunity to improve or\\nchange. Failure was not about whether he would have been successful or not in\\n\\x0cwhatever he tried. Just having a go would have been a success in itself.\\nAnthony’s biggest failure lay in becoming a complete product of his\\nenvironment, lacking any desire to challenge himself and hence, improve his\\nlife. It was such a waste of a good and intelligent person, and of the natural gifts\\nhe had been born with.\\n\\nSo if we were all to become a product of our environment, myself included,\\nthe best thing I could do was to choose the right environments from here on,\\nones that would suit the direction I wanted my life to move toward. It was still\\ngoing to take courage to live the way I wanted. But this new awareness, of the\\npotential effects the surrounding environment could have on me, would make the\\njourney easier.\\n\\nAnd so it was with this consciousness and renewed bravery that I became\\nmore mindful about the life I was creating, and the power that lies in the freedom\\nof choice.\\n\\x0cTRAPPINGS\\neter\\n\\nNot all of the relationships formed with clients started out positive. While the\\nbulk of my work was with dying people, sometimes clients needed care due to\\nmental illness. Because I’d had a positive, calming effect on some other short-\\nterm clients, some more difficult cases started coming my way. No experience in\\nlife is wasted. My past had exposed me to plenty of irrational behaviour that now\\nseemed to help me with difficult people.\\n\\nA lot of the time I was not terribly fazed by challenging clients. I say a lot of\\nthe time though, not all of the time. Sometimes, my calm persona couldn’t\\nappease the client at all, no matter what I tried. Arriving at a magnificent\\nmansion, surely one of the best in the city, the warnings I had been given about\\nthe lady came back to mind. Florence was terribly defensive about needing care,\\ninsisting she didn’t need it at all. This was not new. Plenty of elderly people were\\nreluctant to accept that they were not as independent as they once were. It was\\nnot always easy for them to acknowledge that such a time had come.\\n\\nBut I wasn’t prepared for the mad woman who came chasing me down the\\ndriveway brandishing a broom and yelling at the top of her voice. Her hair had\\nnot been attended to in goodness knows how long. Fingernails were full of dirt\\nor possibly worse. Wearing only one slipper, she hardly represented the\\nCinderella fairytale. And it looked like she had not changed her dress for a year.\\n\\n“Get out. Get off my property,” she screamed. “I'll kill you first. Get off my\\nproperty. You’re just like the rest of them. Get out or I'll kill you.”\\n\\nThe broom swished through the air missing me only slightly. Now, I can\\nhandle a lot in life but I am not stupid. Nor am I a martyr. I did try for one\\nsentence to placate Florence. But with my words falling on deaf ears and her\\nthreats of breaking my windscreen with the broom still lingering, I needed no\\nmore convincing. “OK, OK,” I said, “I’m going Florence. It’s OK”. She looked\\nwild and untamed as she stood at the end of the driveway defending her territory,\\na firm hold still on the broom.\\n\\nDriving off, that image stayed in my rear view mirror until I was completely\\nout of sight. She didn’t budge. As much as it may have appeared to an outsider\\nas a pretty funny scenario, my heart couldn’t help but feel sorry for her too. I\\n\\x0cwondered who she once was, what her life had been and what had driven her to\\nbecome who she now was.\\n\\nA month later those answers were offered, when I was returned to the same\\naddress. Since then, Florence had apparently been taken by force and sedated.\\nThis image is one I hated to imagine. How scared she must have felt. But the last\\nmonth had seen her in a temporary home for those with mental illness and now\\nshe was doing well. Doctors were happy with her response to the medications\\nand were sending her home with advice to have around-the-clock care.\\n\\nThe community nurse was waiting when I arrived. “She’s asleep now, but is\\ndue to wake soon. So I will wait with you until after that,” she explained.\\nOpening the double doors into the mansion, I was greeted by an enormous\\nmarble staircase, chandeliers, and a house full of beautiful, antique furniture. I\\nwas also greeted by a stench that was absolutely rotten.\\n\\n“We’ve finished the entrance. I’ll show you through the rest of the house,” the\\nnurse said, referring to the team of cleaners we came across in the next room.\\nFlorence had been living in a filthy rubbish dump for over ten years with no one\\nrealising until recently, when a neighbour commented to the community nurse\\nabout some unusual and erratic behaviour. When the nurse came to see Florence,\\nthe extent of her squalor was revealed. Not directly by Florence of course, no\\none could approach her, but by looking in the window and seeing the state of her\\nhome.\\n\\nShe was surviving on tinned food and had about a year’s supply in her pantry.\\nI saw no evidence of anything else, certainly nothing fresh or anything able to be\\ncooked. It was almost impossible to see the floor of the kitchen for the rubbish.\\nThe little bit of floor that was revealed was inches thick in black grime.\\nFlorence’s bathroom was no better. It was an unhealthy pit of dirty towels, dried\\nup cakes of soap and obvious signs that no one had used the shower or bath for a\\nvery long time.\\n\\nThe nurse led me downstairs where another six or so bedrooms and a couple\\nof bathrooms lay in similar neglect. The cleaners were contracted to do the\\nwhole house and it was expected to take them a few weeks. Downstairs the\\ndoors opened to a filthy swimming pool; uninhabitable even for frogs I am sure.\\nStanding by the pool and looking back up to the main level of the home and all\\nof its grandeur, I wondered what the walls of this place would say if they could\\ntalk.\\n\\nFlorence had been through a positive transformation with hygiene while in\\nhospital and was resting in a lovely, clean nightdress. Her hair was untangled and\\n\\x0chad been washed and cut, and her fingernails were clean. It was almost like\\nlooking at a different woman.\\n\\nA hospital bed had now replaced her original bed. I was given very firm\\ninstructions that she was to stay in the bed, with the sides up at all times,\\nwhenever I was in the home alone with her. Another carer would come in for\\ntwo hours morning and afternoon to assist me. The mornings were for\\nshowering, toileting and breakfast. The afternoons were focused on getting\\nFlorence out into the garden or onto the balcony to enjoy some fresh air. Heavy\\nsedation was to be a big part of Florence’s management. The rest of the time she\\nwould just be mildly doped. As a result of this patient management plan, she\\nbecame much more obliging.\\n\\nA month passed by and we were now hanging out in a sparkling mansion. The\\ncleaners were finally finished, but were contracted to attend to the home on a\\nweekly basis. Some lovely moments of clarity began flowing from Florence and\\nshe was able to start sharing stories with me. Her life had been grand and\\nexciting. She had sailed the world on the most luxurious ships and visited many\\nfabulous places. When she pointed to drawers nearby, I would hand photos to\\nher as she told me about each one. It was hard to believe this was the same\\nperson, except at times I did recognise her as the young, beautiful woman\\nlaughing in the photos.\\n\\nI wouldn’t say we grew close, but we grew fond enough of each other to\\naccept the situation that had brought us together. There were still moments I\\nglimpsed that mad, wild woman in her though. Having another carer was\\ndefinitely required for her outings from the bed. She was obliging in taking her\\nmedications, yet even so, still put up an enormous fight every day with the\\nshower routine and I came to dread hair wash day immensely. But once out of\\nthe shower, she was a delight and would pamper herself by the mirror, laughing\\nlike the grand woman she was in those days gone by.\\n\\nHer fortune had been in the family forever. Old, old money, she called it. Her\\nhusband had also come from money, but nothing like the league from which she\\nhad originated. After some dodgy business dealings, he was jailed for several\\nyears. The one relative Florence allowed into her life told me it was at this time\\nthat Florence started to become suspicious and paranoid of everyone.\\n\\nHer husband then died within a year of getting out of jail. So no opportunity to\\nheal or reduce her paranoia ever presented itself again and her mental stability\\nworsened. She had trusted him completely and believed everyone else was out to\\nget her money and it was other people who were the cause of his incarceration. It\\n\\x0cmade little difference to my association with her whether he was guilty or not, so\\nI didn’t ponder it for a moment.\\n\\nFlorence accepted life in the hospital bed most of the time. She was just happy\\nto be in her own home and on occasions admitted to loving the company we\\ncarers brought to her. However, a few hours before the other carer returned each\\nafternoon, Florence visited the other side and became a totally different woman\\nagain. I could have almost set a clock to it.\\n\\n“Let me out. Let me out of this damn bed. Help. Help. Help. HELP,” she\\nwould scream, her voice echoing throughout the mansion and off the marble\\nfloors. Walking into her room, I would sometimes manage to settle her for a few\\nseconds, but only a few. I mean, three seconds maximum. Then off it would start\\nagain. “Help. Help. Help. HHHEEEEELLLLLLPPPPP.”\\n\\nIf we weren’t in such a luxurious mansion with thick walls and distance\\nbetween neighbours, I am sure there would have been people ringing the police\\ndaily to report someone screaming. In the end, it made no difference if I was in\\nthe room or not. She would scream for help and to be let out of the bed\\nconstantly until the other carer had arrived and we let her out.\\n\\nThere was no reasoning with her during these times and while I felt for her\\nand was tempted to let her out, I knew her other side. It was not worth risking\\nmy own Safety for. That image of her chasing me with the broom and her wild\\ndetermination had never left me. It was glimpses of this belligerent personality\\nthat I would see in her afternoon shouting match, convincing me to listen to the\\nprofessionals who had set the management routine the way they had. I did feel\\nfor her though. How awful it must have been to be trapped inside your own\\nhome.\\n\\nSide rails on her bed, legalities, and professional decisions were the combining\\nfactors currently trapping Florence. Prior to this though, paranoia had trapped\\nher. Florence’s illness had robbed her of the freedom to leave her own home,\\nwith an obsessive mistrust of people and what they might steal from her if she\\ndid. While most people may not live trapped in a bed, it is possible to create\\nlives where the traps that hold us back are self-created and desperately need\\nreleasing.\\n\\nOne of my earliest memories is of being trapped inside a box. But I didn’t\\nactually feel trapped. It was a large wooden box off the side of the house in the\\ngarden. One of my older siblings convinced me to climb in then locked the door\\non me. I can still remember sitting in the darkness and feeling safe and happy\\nthough. Even when I was only two or three years old I knew I liked my own\\n\\x0ccompany and the peace was beautiful. My mother’s panicked voice came calling\\nsome time later, so I called back and all was well. I was let out and returned to\\nthe chaos of busy family life.\\n\\nOther trappings were present in my adult life now however. While I was\\nfinding the courage to honour my own directions, one step at a time, old thought\\npatterns were not helping me at all. Overcoming my dread of performing was a\\nparticularly hard process, as I tried to release myself from these self-made traps.\\n\\nIf someone had told me that photography and writing would eventually have\\nled me to performing on a stage, I may have once laughed at the absurdity of\\nsuch a thought. It started by me selling my photographic work at markets, then\\ngalleries. Not enough of them sold to create a livable income, but there were\\nsufficient moments of encouragement to keep me on the slow and steady path.\\n\\nFrom these small signs of support, I decided to work within the photography\\nindustry and landed a job in a professional lab in Melbourne. Unfortunately it\\nwas an office job and after a year of boredom, fluorescent lights and no\\nwindows, I acknowledged it was no more satisfying for me than any of my\\nprevious banking jobs. No opportunity had arisen either for me to get into the\\ncreative side of the business and I came to hold no interest in the job at all,\\neventually starting to make mindless mistakes. I remember sighing a lot in that\\njob; leaning on my elbows, chin in the palm of my hand, trying to find the\\nsolution for satisfaction in my working life — then sighing again.\\n\\nFrom this role though, I did come to see how I didn’t need to work in the\\nphotography industry to take nice photos. With the help of a couple of new and\\ndigital savvy friends, I then created a small photography and inspiration book.\\nAgain much support about the quality of my work was forthcoming, but not\\nenough to get the book published. The cost of colour printing was a significant\\nfactor in the advice I received back from publishers, though some commented it\\nwas a beautiful book.\\n\\nFor a few years I gave it everything I had, every ounce of focus and energy.\\nBut the rejection letters continued to pile up, despite some continuing to come\\nwith sincere encouragement. It was during the tears and frustrations of these\\nefforts that I picked up my guitar. I could hardly play it, but proceeded to half\\nwrite my very first song. Little did I know the significance of that moment.\\n\\nHaving learned about the power of surrender, I came to accept that whether\\nthe photography book was ever published or not, it didn’t really matter in the\\nend. I was already a success in my own eyes, for having had the courage to try.\\nSuccess doesn’t depend on someone saying yes, we will publish your book or\\n\\x0cno, we won’t. It is about having the courage to be you regardless. Feeling the\\nlessons I had learned through that whole book process had already brought gifts\\nin themselves, I was finally able to let it go. Perhaps it was simply for my own\\nlearning that this book had flowed through me anyway. Or maybe it would find\\nits feet at another time, when I was more ready.\\n\\nEither way, it didn’t matter. I had to let go. My efforts had left me drained and\\nI had placed too much emphasis on the book being published. It was time to live\\nagain and to stop trying to control the outcome. The song I had half written also\\nremained semi-forgotten while I searched for answers, devoting more and more\\ntime to my meditation path and healing. After one of many stints away in silence\\nand meditation though, I felt a strong urge to finish that half written song. From\\nthat day onwards I knew that songwriting was a part of my life’s work, as not\\nonly did I finish the song, but I also wrote another one the same day. I just\\ncouldn’t get enough of it once started. They poured out of me.\\n\\nAs children, we had put on concerts for relatives and friends. Music was in my\\ngenes. Despite their other so-called ‘sensible’ careers, my father was a guitarist\\nand songwriter when he met my mother, who was a singer at the time. Yet I had\\nnever experienced a conscious yearning to be on the stage. I certainly wasn’t\\nexperiencing it now either. In fact, the thought terrified me. It wasn’t just the\\nidea of being on a stage. It was that my work was calling me into the public\\narena. I was happy to be anonymous. Plenty of songwriters don’t perform and I\\nwanted to be one of those. But to get my work heard initially, performing my\\nown songs was going to be the way.\\n\\nThis terrified me and created enormous turbulence within, for a long stretch.\\nTrying to find work I loved had already been such a painful challenge for me,\\none I never seemed to be able to move past completely. Now I couldn’t accept\\nthat the work I was very clearly being guided to do would actually put me in the\\npublic eye, when I had always loved and guarded my privacy so much. I\\ndefinitely didn’t want to live the life I saw ahead.\\n\\nWe are given lessons to heal though, not necessarily to enjoy. It was a terribly\\nconfronting time. It didn’t help that I was also receiving a lot of negativity from\\nparticular people in regards to my new directions. Either way though, I just\\nlonged for life to swallow me up and let me go on unnoticed.\\n\\nSpending a lot of solitary time at one of my favourite rivers, I swam for weeks\\ntrying to accept that this was where life was going for me. The fresh water\\ncleansed me with every stroke I took. When I swam underneath, the other world\\nslipped away. There were never any sounds out by the river except for birds\\n\\x0csinging and the breeze blowing softly through the trees on the banks. The peace\\nwas healing, so I drank it in often. One day I even saw a platypus, known to bea\\nvery shy creature that rarely comes out around people. Such a blessing restored\\nme.\\n\\nAs I sat on the bank, allowing nature to weave its magic on my very weary\\nsoul, the breeze so soft on my face, I had to be honest with myself. When all of\\nmy life experiences to this point were considered, I saw that deep down, a part of\\nme had always known I would be in the public eye, to some degree. The choice\\nto keep some of my life for me was still going to be my own and I could manage\\nthat. It was my life after all and it was my choice how I handled what unfolded.\\n\\nSo in the end I accepted if this work was a part of my life’s path and I could\\nhelp others by doing so, then hopefully I would somehow grow into my role.\\nTrusting that the learning would also help my own growth, irrespective of who\\nelse would ever hear my music, also assisted my acceptance. The support of a\\ncouple of friends who were musicians was life-saving at the time though.\\n\\nThinking back to when I first started performing, I feel for the audience as\\nmuch as myself. Even if the music was tolerable, it was obvious for a long time\\nthat I found performing painful. My hands would shake, the guitar would\\nbounce, I’d miss strings and my voice would choke up completely. I hated it\\nimmensely and was often sick with nerves. Meditation helped me a lot in this\\nregard. So did practice. Like anything you persevere with, you do eventually get\\nbetter with practice. Yet through all of these nerves and dread, something drove\\nme on. It was the acceptance that this was a part of my life’s work and a\\nyearning to contribute. It was also the desire to be heard. An avenue had been\\npresented to share thoughts that had been suppressed for too long.\\n\\nI was well into my thirties when I finished that first song and another year or\\ntwo passed before I started performing. Not drinking alcohol at all by now meant\\nI had to face my fears head-on, without artificial assistance. Performing helped\\nme to open up though. It brought so many of its own gifts. At the time that I was\\ncaring for Florence, I was also doing the songwriting circuit in the city pubs.\\nMost of this I hated. I was very lonely during this time, as my emotional wounds\\nhad seen me withdraw a long way into myself. Getting up on a stage and singing\\nmy songs was something I managed, but didn’t enjoy for a long time.\\n\\nIt all helped me to grow though. When you are sharing your personal thoughts\\nwith a room full of strangers, it certainly opens you back up again. The\\nconsistently positive response to my songs and what I had to say also\\nencouraged me as a songwriter.\\n\\x0cLater I came to appreciate I was playing in the wrong sort of venues for my\\nstyle and personality. After one too many noisy gigs over the following years, I\\nsaid goodbye to pub gigs forever. I had done my apprenticeship by now. It may\\nhave meant there would be less opportunity to gig, but as performing live in\\npubs and gaining recognition that way wasn’t what drove me, this didn’t bother\\nme at all. By then I was also getting into some folk festivals and had experienced\\nthe bliss a performer gets when you have a respectful audience who not only\\nlistens to your songs, but also understands them totally. That connection with\\nlike-minded people is a fantastic feeling. So from then on, it was beautiful\\nvenues or suitable festivals only.\\n\\nThinking back to who I was when I first started performing though, I hardly\\nrecognise that fragile creature. Now when I play live I am confident, because I\\nam playing in the right venues, to the right audience. My songs are meaningful\\nand mostly gentle. They can be. They’re allowed to be. Iam not competing with\\nthe meat raffle being called out over the microphone in the pubs anymore, or\\nlosing the connection with the audience because the boxing comes onto the\\ntelevision screens on the walls. If I make a mistake, I laugh gently with myself\\nand carry on. After all, performers are human too.\\n\\nIt is also refreshing that Mr. Invincible is no longer ogling me. You know, the\\nguy who has had the most to drink in the pub and suddenly decides he is Johnny\\nDepp’s twin brother. He stands there right in front of the stage, leering at you as\\nhe rocks back and forth, somehow managing not to spill a drop of his eighteenth\\nbeer. He knows without a doubt that he is God’s gift to women as he graces you\\nwith a nod and a wink, while gyrating his hips just for you. And if you are good\\nenough, he will wait for you side-stage to answer all of your prayers in the\\ndepartment of men and great lovers. Yes, I have known them all. Bless them.\\n\\nSo as well as having to face my initial terror in performing, every day I\\ncontinued to walk the creative path was one of courage. I had also recently\\nfinished a year of music study. Deciding I’d like to lear more about the\\nindustry, I taught myself some very basic music theory, at least enough to pass\\nmy audition to the program. The audition also included a very shaky version of\\none of my own songs. But I was in. I was a student in my thirties and I loved\\nevery minute of it.\\n\\nI had to employ different tools when conquering my nerves while performing\\nthough. Practice was one for sure. Consistently putting myself out there\\nimproved my playing, singing and confidence more and more. But the two\\nthings that helped me most of all were the tools I used to set myself free of my\\n\\x0cmind. These tools apply to anything, not just performing, and have helped in\\nother ways since.\\n\\nWhen my nerves would kick in or when negative thoughts surfaced, like\\n“what on earth did I think I was doing up there?”, I would return to my\\nmeditation practice mid-song. I didn’t actually stop the song or sit on the stage in\\nthe lotus position. It wasn’t quite that way. The singing would continue, as\\nwould my guitar playing. But I would change my focus to the breath, observing\\nit going in and out. All the while I would put total trust in my muscle memory,\\nthat it would remember where to put my fingers on the guitar and the words\\nwould continue to flow. It was the breath I had to focus on at that moment. This\\nworked incredibly well, as it calmed me down enough to then return to the song\\nwith better expression and more presence.\\n\\nThe other thing that changed my thinking and truly said goodbye to the nerves,\\nwas when I removed myself from the equation and saw it as a time of giving to\\nthose in the audience. A simple prayer was silently said beforehand, thanking the\\nmusic for flowing through me and bringing these people pleasure. Then I would\\njust get out of the way and enjoy the music as much as the audience.\\n\\nPerforming has taught me many great things. I am very grateful life kept me\\ngoing with it when I didn’t particularly want to. How can we ever know what\\ngifts are awaiting us through the lessons on hand, if we don’t go through them?\\nWe can’t know until we proceed through. Whether I continue to perform or not\\nin future is really of no relevance to me anymore. I will if I do, and I’ll enjoy it\\nimmensely. Or I won’t if I don’t, and I’ll enjoy whatever I do instead immensely.\\nIt doesn’t matter either way. I’ll just go where my path leads.\\n\\nBut through mastering my nerves in performing, I had started to master my\\nmind in other ways too. I was setting myself free of the trappings I had created\\nthrough a lifetime of unhealthy thinking patterns. We all have trappings we need\\nto free ourselves from. Most of those are not physical ones and if they are, it is\\nlikely they originated from non-physical trappings, such as unhealthy thinking\\nand negative belief systems.\\n\\nUnfortunately for dear Florence though, she was still trapped in her bed at\\nleast until the other carer arrived. Because my presence did not lessen the\\nvolume of her yelling, it was naturally kinder on myself to not be in the room.\\nOccasionally I would poke my head in. She would pause for about two seconds,\\nlook at me, then look away and start screaming ‘help’ again. This lady should\\nhave been a singer. She sure had the lungs for it.\\n\\nYachts sailed by on Sydney Harbour. Remembering back to a time when I had\\n\\x0cbeen a friend with some great guys who sailed, I smiled wondering where they\\nhad all ended up. The sound of the doorbell interrupted my reminiscing.\\n\\nAs we lowered the sides on her bed, the yelling ceased in a microsecond. Just\\nlike that. Florence smiled at us. “Well hello to you both. How has your day been\\nso far?” she asked. We both looked at each other smiling, as we helped her out of\\nbed. Although the other carer did not have to endure a few hours of Florence’s\\nscreaming every day, she was still welcomed by it each afternoon.\\n\\n“Great thanks Florence, and yours?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh not too bad, Darling. I’ve just been watching the boats on the harbour.\\nThey race on Wednesdays you know.”\\n\\nAgreeing with her I said, “They sure do, Florence”.\\n\\nWandering around the garden together, we all marvelled at the colours. It too\\nhad been neglected over the years. But the relative who had recently gained\\npower of attorney over Florence’s money had insisted the place look beautiful in\\ncase Florence had any moments of clarity to enjoy it. So gardeners had been in\\nto weave their magic and the pool was clear and clean again.\\n\\n“Look at my beautiful garden,” she told us. “How spectacular it looks at this\\ntime of year.” We both agreed sincerely. Underneath all of the neglect, a lovely\\ngarden had remained and was coming back into its full glory.\\n\\n“T was only out here the other day planting these flowers, you know. You have\\nto stay on top of gardening, especially with all of these creepers.” We smiled and\\nagain agreed. Considering this place was an overgrown, grungy-looking jungle\\nonly a month or two earlier, it was fun to listen to how Florence saw it.\\n\\nPulling some vines away from the flowers, she continued. “You can’t get lazy\\nwith gardens. They need a lot of love and time.” We asked her about some of the\\nflowers and she replied with amazing clarity and knowledge. “This vine will trap\\nthe flowers and strangle them,” Florence told us, as she pulled some more of the\\nvine away. I nodded as she continued, “I would never let anything trap me you\\nknow, and I won’t let anything trap my flowers”.\\n\\nAnd as Florence continued to break the constraints around her beautiful\\ngarden I silently said a prayer of thanks, for having found the courage to start\\nbreaking free of my own constraints. Like a flower, I too was now free to grow\\nand to bloom.\\n\\x0cREGRET 2:\\nI WISH I HADN’T WORKED SO HARD\\n\\nefeKyod?\\n\\nDrying the dishes, I could hear my client John in his office giggling like a\\nschoolboy. “Yes, she’s just the right age too,” he chuckled, continuing to\\ndescribe me to his friend on the phone. John was almost ninety. I was still in my\\nthirties. Recalling a line a seventy-year old man had once told me, ‘all men are\\nboys,’ I smiled to myself shaking my head.\\n\\nComing out of his office later, John was the diplomatic gentleman I knew,\\nwith no sign at all of his mischief. He wanted to take me out to lunch though and\\ndid I have a pink dress to wear? If not, could he buy me one? I laughed and\\npolitely declined his offer of buying me a dress, because I did in fact own a pink\\none. While it was not a part of my uniform for care work, I informed him I was\\nhappy to oblige an old dying man. His delight was wonderful.\\n\\nA table for two was booked at a very expensive restaurant. It was the prime\\ntable, front and centre overlooking a park across to the harbour. John looked\\ndapper in his navy jacket with gold trimmings, a fresh dose of aftershave\\nlingering in the air. With his hand on the small of my back, he guided me to our\\ntable. After looking out at the view, I glanced back to catch him winking to the\\nfour men sitting at a table nearby. They were all giggling while checking me out,\\nbut instantly dropped to straight faces when they realised they were busted.\\n\\n“Friends of yours then, John?” I asked smiling. He stammered and admitted\\nthat he wanted his friends to see how lucky he was to have a carer of such great\\nphysical quality. I cracked up laughing. “Any woman my age is of great physical\\nquality to a room full of eighty-nine year olds.” I must admit though, his\\nmanners were impeccable and I did wish more men from my generation still\\ncarried the charm and dinner etiquette he bestowed upon me. We had a lovely\\nlunch. John had phoned ahead and explained he was bringing a vegan to the\\nrestaurant. They had obliged with a beautiful vegetable loaf, especially baked.\\n\\nIt turns out that his friends were all banned from interrupting our lunch or even\\ncoming to the table. He would introduce me afterwards. So while their lunch had\\nlong finished, they all sat patiently until John and I had finished our lunch and\\n\\x0cconversation. Then, again with his hand on the small of my back, he guided me\\nto their table where I played the perfect girlfriend by charming them all, but\\nensuring John received the most attention. He reminded me of a rooster with all\\nof his feathers up in pride and mating. It was a fun time.\\n\\nUnderneath all of this though, there was a man dying. What harm did it do to\\noblige such a harmless game in what would be one of his last outings? Once\\nhome and out of my pink dress into more practical work clothes, much to John’s\\ndisappointment, I assisted him to bed. The outing may have delighted him, but\\nhe was exhausted too.\\n\\nThe energy of dying people is so weakened that a small outing becomes like\\nworking an eighty-hour week lifting bricks. It completely drains them. Family\\nand friends too don’t often realise how their well-intended visits can exhaust sick\\npeople. When they are in their last week or so, visits of more than five or ten\\nminutes can become hard work for the patient, yet this is when they are usually\\nbombarded with visitors.\\n\\nIt was just John and I this afternoon though and he slept deeply. Folding my\\npink dress away in my bag, it was lovely to have brought him the pleasure he\\ngained from the lunch. It had brought me pleasure too.\\n\\nJohn had also benefitted from my youth in other ways. Understanding\\ncomputers better than he did, I returned to the job in his office that had begun the\\nprevious month. For a man of his age, his approach to computers was admirable\\nas he embarked on grasping the age of technology. His files were a mess though,\\nas he hadn’t known about folders and ordered filing. While he slept, I carried on\\ncreating categories and finding homes for hundreds of documents, all the while\\ncreating an index so things could be found. But like I say, for a man his age, he\\nwas already doing remarkably well on the computer.\\n\\nWhen I saw the deterioration in John the following week, I felt very grateful\\nwe had already been out to lunch. He would not be leaving the house again.\\nThere may still be a few weeks to go, or maybe not, but his strength was\\ndisappearing very quickly. Sitting out on his balcony late that afternoon, we\\nwatched the sun set over the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. John was in\\nhis dressing gown and slippers, trying to eat a little, but struggling. “Don’t worry\\nabout it John, only eat what you can or want to,” I said, as we both knew the\\nunspoken words behind that sentence. John was dying and it wouldn’t be too far\\naway. Nodding, he put the fork on the plate, handing them to me. I sat the tray\\naside and we continued to watch the sunset.\\n\\nOut of the afternoon peace John stated, “I wish I hadn’t worked so hard\\n\\x0cBronnie. What a stupid fool I was”. Sitting in the other lounge chair on the\\nbalcony, I looked across at him. He needed no encouragement to continue. “I\\nworked too damn hard and now I am a lonely, dying man. The worst part is that I\\nhave been lonely for the whole of my retirement and I need not have been.” I\\nlistened as he told me the whole story.\\n\\nJohn and Margaret had raised five children, four of whom now had children of\\ntheir own. The other one had died in his early thirties. When all of the children\\nwere adults and gone from the home, Margaret asked John to retire. They were\\nboth fit and healthy and had enough money behind them to retire well. But he\\nalways said they might need more. Margaret replied each time that they could\\nsell their huge, now almost empty house and buy something more suitable if\\nrequired, freeing up more money. For fifteen years this battle went on between\\nthem, while he kept working.\\n\\nMargaret was lonely and longed to discover their partnership again without\\nchildren or work. For years she devoured travel brochures, suggesting different\\ncountries and regions to visit. John also had a desire to travel more and agreed\\nwith wherever Margaret suggested. Unfortunately, he also enjoyed the status his\\nwork gave him. He told me he didn’t particularly like the work itself, just the\\nrole it gave him in society and amongst his friends. The chase of closing a deal\\nhad also become a bit of an addiction for him.\\n\\nOne evening with Margaret in tears, begging him to finally retire, he looked at\\nthis beautiful woman and realised that not only was she desperately lonely for\\nhis company, but they were both old people now. This wonderful woman had\\nwaited so patiently for him to retire. Looking at her, she was still as beautiful as\\nthe day he had met her. But it was the first time in his life John considered they\\nwere not going to live forever.\\n\\nAlthough petrified for reasons he could now not justify, he agreed to retire.\\nMargaret had jumped up and hugged him, her tears switching from sadness to\\njoy. But the smile didn’t last long, disappearing the minute he added “in one\\nmore year.” There was a new deal being negotiated at the moment in the\\ncompany and he wanted to see it through. She had waited fifteen years for him to\\nretire. Surely she could wait for one more. It was a compromise, but one she\\nreluctantly agreed to. As the sun dropped out of view John told me he felt selfish\\nfor his choice even then, but he couldn’t retire without doing just one more deal.\\n\\nDreaming of this time for years, things started to become real for his beloved\\nwife. She made some actual plans, on the phone to the travel agent regularly.\\nEach night as he wandered in, she would be waiting for him with dinner\\n\\x0cprepared. As they ate at the table that had once accommodated their whole\\nfamily, she shared her thoughts and ideas with great excitement. John was\\nstarting to warm to the idea of retirement now too, although still insisted on\\nseeing the twelve months out if Margaret ever suggested otherwise.\\n\\nWith four months since his acceptance to retire and eight still to go, Margaret\\nbegan feeling queasy. At first it was a bit of nausea, but after almost a week it\\nhad not passed. “I’ve made an appointment with the doctor tomorrow,” she told\\nhim as he came in from work. The night was already dark. Traffic continued in\\nthe distance, as other workers headed home. “I’m sure it’s nothing though,” she\\nsaid with attempted cheerfulness.\\n\\nWhile John was concerned she was not feeling well, it didn’t cross his mind it\\nmay be more until the following night, when Margaret said the doctor had\\nsuggested some tests. Even if the results had not said so within the following\\nweek however, the increase in her discomfort and then pain would have told\\nthem something was wrong. They just hadn’t expected how wrong. Margaret\\nwas dying.\\n\\nWe spend so much time making plans for the future, often depending on things\\ncoming at a later date to assure our happiness or assuming we have all of the\\ntime in the world, when all we ever have is our life today. It was not difficult to\\nunderstand the deep regrets John was now living with. I understand how people\\ncan love their work and there is no need for guilt in doing so. I too now loved\\nnow my work, despite the sadness that often accompanied it.\\n\\nBut when asked if he would have enjoyed his work so much if he hadn’t had\\nsuch a supportive family life, John shook his head. “I liked the work enough,\\nsure. And I definitely loved the status, though what’s the point of that now? I\\ngave less time to what truly kept me going through life: Margaret and my family,\\nmy dear Margaret. Her love and support were always there. But I wasn’t there\\nfor her. She was a lot of fun too. We would have had such a good time away\\ntogether.”\\n\\nMargaret had died three months before John was due to retire, though he had\\nretired by then due to her health. John shared how his retirement had been\\nplagued with guilt ever since. Even when he was able to come to a certain place\\nof acceptance about his ‘mistake’, as he called it, he longed to be travelling and\\nlaughing with Margaret now.\\n\\n“T think I was scared. Yes, I was. I was petrified. My role had come to define\\nme in a way. Of course now as I sit here dying, I see that just being a good\\nperson is more than enough in life. Why do we depend so much on the material\\n\\x0cworld to validate us?” John thought out loud, random sentences filled with\\nsadness for both past and future generations who wanted everything, basing their\\nimportance on what they owned and what they did, rather than on who they were\\nin their heart.\\n\\n“There’s nothing wrong in wanting a better life. Don’t get me wrong,” he said.\\n“Tt’s just that the chase for more, and the need to be recognised through our\\nachievements and belongings, can hinder us from the real things, like time with\\nthose we love, time doing things we love ourselves, and balance. It’s probably all\\nabout balance really, isn’t it?”\\n\\nAgreeing, I quietly nodded. A few stars were out above us now and the\\ncolourful city lights were reflected on the water. Balance had always been a bit\\nof a challenge for me too. It seemed to be all or nothing, even in this role.\\nTwelve-hour shifts were my normal working day and as the clients neared the\\nend, they and their families wanted as much consistency with the carers as\\npossible. So it wasn’t unusual to work six days per week during their last month,\\nsometimes even taking on a sleepover shift in between, meaning I was there for\\nthirty-six hours straight. An eighty-four hour week is not healthy for anyone,\\neven if you love the work you do.\\n\\nSometimes the clients would sleep, but I still had to be there. Plenty of other\\nduties called. It felt like my own life was on hold, though in hindsight it wasn’t\\nof course, as this too was a part of it. When the client’s life had passed, I was\\nexhausted. It usually turned out that another regular client would not arise for\\nsome time after a run like that. So I welcomed the time off, caught up with\\nfriends again, returned to my music and writing, and then did it all over again.\\nThe time off was wonderful, particularly in large blocks with only a random shift\\nor two somewhere in between. But the inconsistency put a lot of pressure on my\\nincome. If the work stopped, the money stopped.\\n\\nAround this time, I was offered one day a week as an office manager in a pre-\\nnatal centre. It was steady work and I loved it. The centre ran birthing courses\\nfor pregnant women and mothers’ groups. There were weeks when I would go\\nfrom nursing people who were ready to die that week or very soon after, to\\nhaving toddlers climbing over me while I worked, placing sloppy kisses on my\\ncheeks.\\n\\nIt was a healthy reminder about the joys of life and the full circle. As a client\\npassed on, a new babe would arrive at the centre. The little ones were so\\nincredibly fragile and beautiful. My boss, Marie was one of the most wonderful\\npeople I have ever known, with a heart as big as they come. I loved her and still\\n\\x0cdo. Part of my role would be to update the course material for the pre-natal\\nclasses. As a result, much of my day would be spent reading about how women\\nof different cultures around the world approached pregnancy and the whole birth\\nprocess. It reinforced how fear is conditioned into us as Westerners, when I saw\\nhow naturally many cultures approached things and how reduced the pain of\\nbirth was for some. It was treated as a joyous, beautiful celebration from start to\\nfinish.\\n\\nBeing around birth and life was very healthy for me. Hanging out with the\\ndying and having such a strong empathy for the clients and families, did wear\\nme down sometimes. There are people all over the world who devote their whole\\nlives to working with dying people. Perhaps they have mastered detachment\\nmore than I had. Or balance. I don’t know. My full respect goes out to them\\nregardless. What I do know is that having one day a week revolving around the\\nbeginning of the life cycle rather than the end, brought lightness to my life I\\nhadn’t known was missing during these years. The energy was fresh and alive,\\nlike someone had opened the windows for me, and let clean air blow through.\\n\\nHaving the contrasts on a weekly basis also helped me to see my dying clients\\nas babies once. And as new mums proudly showed me their dear newborns, I too\\nconsidered the babies would hopefully grow older and live a full life. Then one\\nday they too would reach the end of their lives, as my clients were doing. It was\\na pretty interesting time, to be so exposed to both ends of the spectrum. It was a\\nblessing.\\n\\nFrom that time, I was able to grow in compassion more for others in my life,\\nas I recognised that they too were once just fragile little babies and they too will\\none day die, as will I. I started to see my parents, siblings, friends, and strangers\\nas babies and young children, once trusting in life with the innocence and hope\\nthat young children do. I thought about who they were before the wounds of\\nothers, whether that be family, peers, or society, were dumped on them, affecting\\nthe natural trust and openness they were born with. The goodness of people’s\\nhearts became clear to me and I began to love them all with the protectiveness of\\na caring mother.\\n\\nNo longer did I see the hurtful things said over the years as truly coming from\\nthem. The words were coming from their wounds, not the beautiful, pure beings\\nthey were born as. Each of those precious babies born decades ago were still a\\npart of them. A dear, little, innocent child also still lived within each of them.\\nAnd one day they would also receive the wisdom of hindsight that comes to so\\nmany people with the dying process.\\n\\x0cThere may be times I thought I didn’t love particular people in my life. But I\\nsaw it was only their behaviour and words I did not love. Now I loved their\\ninnocent hearts, hearts that once trusted the world would bring them happiness\\nand look after them. When it didn’t, suffering kicked in and their pain and\\ndisillusionment saw them reacting in ways that were not wholesome. I was no\\ndifferent. I too had caused others pain, through my own suffering, my own\\ndisappointment that life hadn’t turn out as I’d hoped. That little girl whose trust\\nhad been broken by being exposed to other’s pain had then reacted with pain of\\nher own.\\n\\nThe hearts of my dear family, and of everyone, still contained that original\\npurity. It was just clouded over with pain and life. Whether I would ever find the\\nhappiness and friendship I had once hoped for with some people was still to be\\ndetermined. Either way, it didn’t really matter anymore. I now saw that they\\nwere all once beautiful little babies with all of the trust and innocence a baby\\nhas. Anything said that was not kind to others was simply the suffering,\\nmanifesting from a little child who had lost their way, as I had too. And for that\\nalone I could continue to love them.\\n\\nSitting beside John on the balcony, I saw the fragile child in him too; a\\nprecious little boy who somehow decided through whatever he was exposed to,\\nthat proving himself through his work, was going to make him happier than to\\ngo travelling with his wife. He was an old man now, yet that little innocent child\\nwithin him was still obvious. Slow tears fell down his cheeks occasionally as he\\nsighed deeply. Leaving him to his thoughts and privacy I took the dishes inside\\nand cleaned up. On returning I placed a rug over his legs and kissed him on the\\ncheek before sitting down again.\\n\\n“If I can tell you one thing about life Bronnie, it’s this. Don’t create a life\\nwhere you are going to regret working too hard. I can say now that I didn’t know\\nI was going to regret it, until I was at this time facing the very end. But deep in\\nmy heart, I knew I was working too hard. Not just for Margaret, but for me too. I\\nwould love to have not cared what others thought of me, as I do now. I wonder\\nwhy we have to wait until we are dying to work things like this out.” Shaking his\\nhead, he kept talking. “There is nothing wrong with loving your work and\\nwanting to apply yourself to it. But there is so much more to life. Balance is\\nwhat is important, maintaining balance.”\\n\\n“T agree John. It has been a lesson for me already but I’m working on it, don’t\\nworry,” I admitted honestly. He knew what I meant. We had shared enough\\nstories by now for him to understand me. John then started laughing to himself.\\n\\x0cSo I questioned him, encouraging him to share the joke.\\n\\n“Well, I said if there was one thing I could tell you, it is to not regret working\\ntoo hard. But I just thought of another, almost as important.”\\n\\n“Go on then,” I smiled.\\n\\nHe looked at me with mischief in his eyes and said, “Don’t you ever throw out\\nthat pink dress!”\\n\\nLaughing, John pointed to my chair then tapped the side of his, indicating for\\nme to bring my chair over, which I did as I laughed too. Another couple of hours\\npassed as we sat side-by-side overlooking the harbour, a rug each over us. Now\\nand then the conversation would drift into a comfortable silence, before more\\nconversation resumed. Other moments of silence though were simply broken by\\na deep sigh from John. I took his hand and he squeezed mine in response.\\n\\nLooking across at me with a sad smile, he told me, “If I can leave any good in\\nthis world besides my family, I leave these words. Don’t work too hard. Try to\\nmaintain balance. Don’t make work your whole life”. Smiling back gently, I\\nlifted his hand up and kissed the back of it.\\n\\nJohn passed away not long after that night. Although I didn’t know it then, his\\nwords were to be repeated to me time and again by others I came to care for. He\\nhad made his point though and it was one I would never forget.\\n\\x0cPURPOSE AND INTENTION.\\neter\\n\\nWord of mouth had begun working in my favour with my living situation. The\\ntime at Ruth’s house had now well passed. But a network of wonderful people\\nhad started to see the mutual benefit of me looking after their homes when they\\nwere away. While there were occasions that it wore me down, moving house\\nevery few weeks or months, it also exposed me to many beautiful homes. One of\\nthem even backed onto the home of the wealthiest man in the country. So I was\\ncertainly living in some affluent surroundings.\\n\\nWith many of the house-sits came a cleaner and a gardener, sometimes a\\nseparate window washer too. My only role was to live in the home as if it was\\nmy own and to enjoy it. Needless to say, this was not difficult. As well as this\\nnetwork being of very wealthy people, some were also incredibly creative. So\\nthe homes were often bright, colourful and welcoming.\\n\\nIt was through one of my house-sitting clients I came to care for Pearl. Her\\nhome was cheerful, as was she, at least as much as is possible for a dying person.\\nWe liked each other instantly. She also had three dogs, one of which was usually\\nvery timid with strangers, but was sitting on my lap within minutes. (Animals\\nknow animal lovers). The little black dog’s response to me helped Pearl’s and\\nmy rapport immediately.\\n\\nSome months earlier, just prior to her sixty-third birthday, Pearl had been\\ndiagnosed with terminal illness. Because of her dogs and the love of her home,\\nshe was determined to die in her own bed. A friend had already offered to adopt\\nall three dogs when the time came, so Pearl was peaceful they would be able to\\nstay together. She was also quite accepting of her approaching passing.\\n\\nMany of the clients I had cared for by now had been in denial initially about\\ntheir situations. They would go through a range of emotions before finally\\naccepting the inevitable outcome. Other clients were in shock as the news had\\nbeen delivered to them in such a way that it was too much to bear. The conveyer\\nof such news occasionally did so in a manner that was just too matter-of-fact, not\\nunderstanding the full impact of their delivery. Sometimes this was family.\\nSometimes it was medical professionals. True gentleness is definitely needed on\\nsuch occasions though.\\n\\x0cPearl however, was very much at a place of acceptance that her time had\\ncome. A part of what made this easier, she told me, was that she had lost her\\nhusband and their only child, a little girl, a year apart more than thirty years ago.\\nShe knew in her heart she would be seeing them again soon.\\n\\nHer husband had been taken suddenly in a work accident, although she didn’t\\nlike to use the word ‘accident’, as she believed there was no such thing. “It was\\nmeant to be,” she told me. “It brought me enormous pain, but with more than\\nthirty years of living since, I have come to see how that loss helped me to\\nbecome the person I now am and to help others. I wouldn’t be who I am without\\nhaving experienced his passing.”\\n\\nShe was philosophical too about losing her little girl. Tonia had died of\\nleukemia at eight years old. “Losing a child is as bad as everyone says it is. No\\nparent should have to experience it. But they do you know, all over the world,\\nevery single day. Iam merely one of many.” I listened and appreciated the peace\\nthat came from her, as she discussed her daughter. “I am glad for her that she\\ndidn’t suffer for too long. I believe she came into my life to teach me the joy of\\nunconditional love. Since then I have been able to give that to others, even\\nwithout being related to them. Dear Tonia, my dear little angel.”\\n\\nThe memories had faded from being clear pictures in her mind, but had not\\ndiminished at all in her heart. Pearl’s love for her daughter was as strong as ever.\\nLove doesn’t die, she told me joyously. She went on to share how life had been\\ndifficult for some time after Tonia’s passing, taking quite a few years for the\\nwheels to start turning again properly. But she didn’t ever see herself as a victim.\\nAlthough she knew the pain of losing a child and wouldn’t wish that on anyone,\\nshe’d also known the joy of having a child, which as she pointed out, not\\neveryone has such opportunity to.\\n\\nWe agreed there is always a gift in any challenge. “People play the victim\\nforever,” she continued. “But who are they kidding? They are only robbing\\nthemselves. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Neither does anyone else. Only you\\nowe yourself. So the best way to make the most out of life is to appreciate the\\ngift of it, and choose not to be a victim.”\\n\\nI explained to Pearl how I had known quite a few victims in my time, but the\\nbiggest wake-up call was when I had recognised it in myself at one stage. It had\\ntaken me completely by surprise when I saw that I had become so caught up in\\nmy wounds, I was only able to focus on how hard my life had been.\\n\\nShe agreed without judgment. “We can all be guilty of it at some time. There\\nis a fine line between compassion and a victim mentality. Compassion though is\\n\\x0ca healing force and comes from a place of kindness towards yourself. Playing the\\nvictim is a toxic waste of time that not only repels other people, but also robs the\\nvictim of ever knowing true happiness. No one owes us anything,” she said\\nagain. “We only owe ourselves to get off our backsides, count our blessings, and\\nface our challenges. When you live from that perspective, the gifts pour forth.” I\\nloved this woman.\\n\\nShe continued speaking about how hard many people’s lives are, how some\\nfolks are given such enormous challenges, yet they still manage to soldier on and\\nfind happiness in little things along the way. Yet others complain non-stop about\\ntheir life when they have no idea how good they really have it, compared to\\nothers. Agreeing with Pearl on this was easy, as despite the pain I still carried at\\ntimes, I didn’t lose sight of the blessings I received too. There was always\\nsomeone much worse off.\\n\\nWhen Pearl did manage to get her life on track again after the loss of her\\nhusband and daughter, she threw herself into her work for several years. It was\\nwork that she liked enough. She loved her co-workers and the customers, and\\nfelt a part of her reason to be there was to keep them inspired and happy, which\\nshe did well. There was always emptiness in her though. For almost two\\ndecades, she had put it down to the loss of her family.\\n\\nA passing comment one day changed her life and she found herself helping a\\ncustomer outside of hours, who was developing a new community program.\\nWithout being terribly conscious of it, Pearl became more and more involved,\\nsimply because she loved the project and what these people were about. “For the\\nfirst time in more than twenty years, I knew passion again. And do you know\\nwhy?” she asked, as I waited. “I had purpose, true purpose. That was what the\\nemptiness had been with my work. It didn’t have enough purpose for me.”\\n\\nIt was not difficult for me to relate to this. I shared my previous work history\\nwith Pearl, including the struggles I went through until I found myself working\\nin palliative care and in music, both of which were bringing increasing\\ncontentment. She agreed that my work truly had purpose, particularly compared\\nto other roles I had done. But like me, she believed anyone could find true\\npurpose in his or her work if they are in the right field for who they are. It was\\njust a matter of perspective.\\n\\nPearl’s home had a beautiful conservatory where the winter sun would shine in\\non us through the glass roof. It was bright and lovely. Each morning I would\\nwheel her out there, usually with at least one dog on her lap, sometimes all three.\\nWe would drink gallons of fresh herbal teas while delighting in the gift of each\\n\\x0cnew day. When I commented to her that being there didn’t feel like work at all\\nfor me, she brightened up and said, “Of course, that is how it should be. When\\nyou are doing work you love, it doesn’t feel like work. It is simply a natural\\nextension of who you are”.\\n\\nThe community project evolved into Pearl finding her life’s work. Within a\\nyear she had resigned from her old job and was fully devoted to her new role.\\nThe pay was less initially but she didn’t care. Over time, it did increase though.\\n“Sometimes you have to take some steps back to get a run-up before you jump,”\\nshe laughed. “Money is so misunderstood. It keeps people in the wrong jobs\\nforever because they think they won’t be able to make money doing what they\\nlove. When it can really be the other way around. If you totally love what you\\ndo, you can become more open to the flow of money because you are more\\nabsorbed in your work and are happier as a person. Of course, it takes some time\\nto change your thinking and to stop trying to work out how the money will\\ncome.”\\n\\nA friend of mine had once put it well and I shared this with Pearl. We put too\\nmuch emphasis on the money. What we need to do is work out what we want to\\ndo, what project, and work toward that with focus, determination and faith.\\nDon’t make it about the money. Make it about the project instead. Then the\\nmoney will attach itself to you naturally, often through unimagined sources.\\n\\nMy leaps of faith had also taught me this already. When the money stopped, it\\nwas usually because I was focusing on that fear of lack, so I received more lack.\\nWhen I focused on the beauty of the day, counted my blessings and worked\\ntowards whatever I was being guided to do, what I needed would flow my way.\\n\\nOne of the greatest rewards for having the courage to keep working towards\\nwhat I wanted was when I recorded my first album. The timing was going to be\\nperfect, as I would be living in one of my favourite and most regular house-sits,\\nwhere we could record. It was a gorgeous dark pink house that overlooked a\\npocket of rainforest. The same block of time worked well for all involved. My\\nproducer particularly was a very busy man, but had managed to allocate the\\ntime. Other musicians were also happy with the schedule. There was only one\\nthing missing. Money! I had some, but not enough.\\n\\nEverything in me though said to prepare as if it was happening, so I did.\\nMusicians were booked in. I dedicated time to rehearsing, fine-tuning songs. But\\nas the days drew nearer, the faith that had propelled me to this point began to\\nwaiver. I knew deep down I wouldn’t have been guided to do this if it wasn’t\\npossible. So during stronger moments, total belief existed that it would all go\\n\\x0cahead. After all, I had done other leaps of faith in the past. I believed in myself\\nand in my ability to draw the things I needed to me. But fear was starting to\\nbubble to the surface, to the point where my faith could no longer keep the lid on\\nit.\\n\\nWe were due to begin recording on Monday. It was Friday afternoon and still\\nthe money had not turned up. Fear began raging. The producer could not afford\\nthe time off unpaid. The other musicians too had limited time available.\\nBeginning to panic, I went straight to my meditation cushion and sat. Tears\\nsprang forth. They had been building for a few months as I had tried to stay\\ntotally focused and strong. Now they were pouring out. Sobbing, I released all of\\nmy frustrations, admitting that I couldn’t do it anymore. I had no strength left. I\\nhad done what I was guided to, but couldn’t keep going. It was all too hard. I just\\ncould not do it anymore.\\n\\nThen “Ahh!” That beautiful moment of surrender! There it was. There was\\nnothing more I could do. I simply had to hand it over to the greater forces.\\nFeeling frightened and drained, I decided to go out and see some music as a\\ndistraction. A friend phoned just then, not knowing my situation, and invited me\\nto come out with her and another friend. They were going to a café/bookshop. It\\nfelt more appealing than heading out alone to see a band, so I accepted.\\nPromising myself to enjoy the night and forget about my situation, I headed out\\nhappily. Tomorrow was a new day and I would deal with things then. But tonight\\nI just needed to forget about it.\\n\\nAs my friend Gabriela browsed through the books, I sat on the lounge in the\\ncafé chatting with her friend. Leanne and I had met only once, very briefly in\\npassing a few years earlier and had not crossed paths since. She asked where I\\nlived so I explained my house-sitting life. This intrigued her but also assisted, as\\nshe was about to go into the housing market and valued my opinions of the\\ndifferent suburbs I had lived in by now. On being questioned further, I told her\\nhow I had fallen into this lifestyle as a result of wanting to be rent-free and to\\nwork on my creative stuff, particularly music.\\n\\nLeanne was going through a very messy divorce, and welcomed the distraction\\nfrom her own life as much as I did from mine. So the conversation continued to\\nflow naturally. She then asked about my album and I was brought back to my\\ncurrent situation, regretful that I had allowed the conversation to get onto this\\ntopic. But I told her honestly where things were at, and how I was waiting on a\\nmiracle to save me.\\n\\nShe asked me more about the album, about the people working on it with me,\\n\\x0cwhat instrumentation we had planned, where I’d come from with my music and\\nwhat drove me to perform, which I told her. Then without another moment’s\\nhesitation, she declared that she had always wanted to support the arts, did not\\nknow who to support, was going through a crappy time in her own life, needed\\nto do something positive, and would be at my place on Monday morning with\\nthe cash I needed.\\n\\nTears of relief and joy burst out of me. I couldn’t believe it. Without a thought,\\nI hugged her sincerely, fighting back the urge to sob completely. It was over. I\\nhad done it. The album was happening. The money had attached itself to me.\\n\\nLeanne came along for some of the recording. It was lovely to have her there,\\nlying on the long carpet listening through headphones as we sang and played,\\nrecording each new track. She was pretty detached to it all though. Just happy to\\nsee it happening was enough for her. What a beautiful, generous woman she was.\\nThis incident gave me strength for every leap of faith afterwards too. The help\\ndoes come. We just have to get out of the way.\\n\\nPearl delighted in this story as it reinforced everything she believed in. “That’s\\nexactly right. Fear blocks us up entirely. Money is just another kind of energy, an\\nenergy that wants to bring good and happiness to us all. But we use it wrongly,\\ngiving it power, chasing it, fearing it, unbalancing our lives in its pursuit, as we\\nobsess over it,” she stated. “It is as available as the air we breathe. We don’t\\nwaste our time worrying if there will be enough air. We shouldn’t waste our time\\nworrying if there will be enough money. Those very thoughts are what block the\\nnatural flow of this loving, creative energy to us.” I understood and agreed.\\n\\nWhen Pearl had first joined the community project, funding had been a\\nconstant concern for the people already working there. All of their energy had\\nbeen going into how the money would be found, not why it was needed.\\nThankfully the team of workers was open to Pearl’s philosophies. While they\\ndidn’t initially have enough faith in themselves to believe they could attract the\\nfunds needed for each section of the project, they had faith in Pearl’s faith. So\\nthey agreed to keep working towards the project’s success, with the trust that the\\nfunds would come, but all the while taking whatever active steps were possible\\nto assist this. They were also learning to let go when there was no more that\\ncould be done in that regard and to just keep working as if the funds were\\nalready on their way. Pearl’s faith was unwavering though and as a result, she\\ninspired the team enormously.\\n\\nMoney soon began to flow to the project from numerous unexpected sources,\\ncreating great joy amongst the workers. The program expanded into another\\n\\x0csuburb, helping more people. In a few years, Pearl and some others were all\\nearning decent money, expanding the program yet again, helping more and more\\npeople in need and never for a moment, feeling like it was work.\\n\\nThe sun had now moved over the house and we returned to the living room,\\nwhere I had lit the fire a little earlier. Pearl was exhausted but didn’t believe in\\ngoing to bed until it was evening, if she could help it. She took her rests during\\nthe day on the settee in by the fire. Making her comfortable, I adjusted the\\npillows and placed a lovely big rug over her. Like Pearl and all of her home, it\\nwas also colourful. The fire threw beautiful light across the room, offering a\\nfeeling of comfort. When she was settled, the dogs jumped up and snuggled in. It\\nwas a beautiful scene; Pearl, the dogs, the fire, the colours of her home, and is\\none that remains clear in my mind these years later.\\n\\n“Tt is about intention mostly though, this money thing,” she declared. Carrying\\na chair over to be closer, I continued to listen, enjoying her thoughts. “Money\\nflows best when the intention is honorable. We were able to find funds for the\\nproject because it was for the good of others. Of course we benefitted from this\\ntoo by earning money doing what we loved, as well as enjoying a sense of\\npurpose in our lives.”\\n\\nPearl said this is why purpose was so important in our work. If we find\\npurpose in it, we naturally approach it with the right intention. Any work with\\npurpose will benefit someone else somehow. The money will come to support\\nthat intention; providing we take what action we can and don’t block the flow\\nwith fear. People of middle age, in particular, find many questions arising and\\nfeel a longing to somehow connect with the world through their work. This is the\\nnatural yearning for purpose Pearl spoke of.\\n\\nShe was an intelligent and wise woman and shared her thoughts freely. I\\nimagined it would have been the same easy flow between us, even if she hadn’t\\nbeen dying. Pearl continued, stating that parents for example, don’t always\\nbelieve their own worth and how their intention to raise happy children is one of\\nthe greatest contributions anyone can make to society. It breeds good adults. She\\nhated to hear any mother say they were just a mum, when it was the most\\nimportant thing and a job of true purpose. The same even went for people in\\ntheir gardens, celebrating the beauty of the earth.\\n\\nThinking of a lovely lady I had known when I was living over in Perth, I\\nshared how her garden had brought me happiness every morning as I walked to\\nthe train station. It brought so much pleasure with blooming flowers and\\ncolourful trees that I ended up putting a card in her mailbox to thank her for the\\n\\x0cdelight she gave me. The garden truly did make every day better for me.\\nColourful flowers and exotic plants worked in beautiful symmetry with each\\nother, each day revealing another change, another view. People don’t always\\nrealise the joy they bring to others. One day I finally saw the gardener herself, an\\neighty-year old woman, and told her how much I loved her place. It took Yvonne\\nno time to work out that it was me who had written the card and a new\\nfriendship began.\\n\\n“Yes, that was her purpose — the garden. Finding purpose in life is one of the\\nmost important things ever,” Pearl went on. “In some ways, I wish I hadn’t\\nwasted all of those years in a job that was pleasant but of very little significance\\nto my true life’s work, the work I found through the project. It led me to where I\\nwas meant to be though, as it was a customer from there who helped me to find\\nmy way to that change. It can take years to work out what you want to do, and it\\ndid for me. But the satisfaction that awaits will make the search worth it for\\nanyone.”\\n\\nConsidering the struggle I too had gone through to find work that satisfied me,\\nI agreed it was worth it. Sitting by the fire with this beautiful woman and three\\nsweet natured dogs, I felt very grateful to be able to call this my work. I told\\nPearl this and she smiled in agreement.\\n\\n“If I had any regrets Bronnie, it would be that I wish I’d not spent so many\\nyears in an average job. Life is over so quickly. I knew this from losing my\\nfamily. But sometimes we can know things for a long time before we are ready\\nto act on them, unfortunately. So I could regret it, but I am not going to. Instead I\\nprefer to be gentle, forgiving myself for not being able to leave that job sooner,\\nfor not seeing the signposts clearly enough until later.” Agreeing that self-\\nforgiveness was a much healthier state than regret, I told Pearl how much I was\\nlearning through my clients.\\n\\nShe laughed saying, “That’s right. You have no excuse. You cannot go to your\\ndeathbed and say you wished you’d worked it out sooner. You are being blessed\\nby all of our mistakes instead”. Laughing, I shared her opinion. But I could see\\nthe talking was now also exhausting Pearl and she agreed. So I made sure she\\nwas comfortable then closed the curtains, leaving her to rest in the light of the\\nfire. Standing at the door watching her and the three dogs for a moment, a slow\\ntear rolled down my cheek.\\n\\nAlthough I was still learning to realise my true worth, I was overwhelmed with\\ngratitude that I at least now had a job with heart. Smiling then, I headed into the\\nkitchen. After making a cup of chai, I enjoyed another peaceful room of the\\n\\x0chouse while Pearl slept. It was a quiet afternoon in the neighbourhood, though it\\nwould have made no difference here. It was always a peaceful home, both in\\nvolume and energy.\\n\\nI shared another few weeks with Pearl, but she grew weaker every day until\\nfinally accepting that getting out of bed was just too hard. Acknowledging that\\nshe had appreciated her home to its fullest, she asked me to continue\\nappreciating it for my remaining time there, on her behalf. I smiled and said no\\nworries. But it was Pearl I appreciated much more than her lovely home.\\n\\nFriends came to say their goodbyes, including those she had worked with on\\nthe community projects. They spoke of how she had changed their lives and how\\nher work had left a permanent footprint, helping so many others. It doesn’t need\\nto be grand work to have purpose though. Some people are able to help\\nthousands. Some may only help one or two. Either way, the work is just as\\nimportant. We all have a purpose and working towards finding that purpose\\ncontributes to the good of all. And of course, it helps each of us too. Work then,\\nis no longer work, but as Pearl said, a satisfying extension of ourselves.\\n\\nWhen I closed the door behind me on the day of Pearl’s passing, I walked out\\ninto a day of beautiful winter sunshine. Pausing and taking a deep breath, I\\nwelcomed the winter sun shining down on my face. Through all of that searching\\nduring my years in banking, it had only ever been my intention to find work I\\nloved.\\n\\nNow in the winter sunshine, I smiled thinking of Pearl and the wonderful\\nperson she was. I had indeed found work I loved and for that I felt blessed. It\\ntook some time for me to move off from her front garden, lost in my thoughts\\nand gratitude, and sending Pearl love. But either way, it didn’t matter. I was\\nsmiling and I had my work to thank for that.\\n\\x0cSIMPLICITY\\neter\\n\\nUnderstandably, the families of those dying also suffered enormously during the\\nclient’s last weeks. The general age range for most of the families was early\\nforties to late fifties, with the majority of them having children themselves.\\n\\nThe fear of losing their parent, and perhaps the fear of their own pain,\\ntriggered some intense behaviour. This was one of the areas where I was often\\nreminded how detrimental it is to live in a society that tries to keep death hidden.\\nPeople are not only unprepared to deal with the enormity of emotions that\\nsurface, but they become desperately scared and vulnerable, the families often\\nmore so. The clients found their peace before they departed. But the children\\noften had emotions that were totally out of control, ruled by fear and panic.\\n\\nWorking within private homes exposed me to the lifestyles and dynamics of a\\nhuge amount of families. It taught me that almost all families have challenges on\\nsome levels, things to heal and to learn through each other. Some were not even\\ncompletely aware of the triggers each person served to ignite. But they were\\ndefinitely there. When I would hear siblings getting impatient or upset with their\\nbrother or sister, I would respectfully stay out of it, and try to view the situation\\nas compassionately as possible.\\n\\nControl issues were paramount at this time too. Often there was one sibling\\nwho wanted to control everything: the running of the home, the grocery list, the\\ncarers, the approaching funeral, everything. When other siblings tried to\\ncontribute or have a say, arguments sometimes broke out. Everyone has a right to\\ncontribute, particularly as limited time left increases this desire for everyone. But\\nthe controlling person in the family often intensified their need to rule even\\nmore. It was heartbreaking to watch this exhibition of power, or attempted\\npower, as it was so fear driven.\\n\\nThe wellbeing of the client was my first priority though, over absolutely\\neverything else. So when I heard a screaming match begin and intensify over\\nCharlie’s bed, I was into the room in a flash. My lovely client lay beneath his\\nadult children, Greg and Maryanne, as they screamed desperately at each other\\nacross the bed, out of control. “Enough of this please,” I stated firmly but gently.\\n“Take it into the other room if you must continue. Look at your dad. He is lying\\n\\x0chere dying for goodness sakes.”\\n\\nMaryanne burst into tears, apologising to her father. Charlie was a peaceful\\nman, and always had been apparently. “He just hassles me all the damn time,”\\nshe said of her brother. Maryanne had beautiful blue eyes and long black hair,\\nsomeone who should be an artist’s model I thought to myself. But her eyes were\\nred from crying, and so sad.\\n\\nWithout pause, Greg retaliated in anger. “Well, I don’t see why you should get\\nas much as me in the will. You moved away. You’ve made less effort. I have\\nworked harder, and been here for Dad the most since Mum died.” My heart\\nached for Greg and this reasoning. It was just a fragile, wounded, little boy\\nunderneath these words. I could see their dad in both of them, but I think Greg\\nmust have looked like his mum too. His hair was brown and his skin fairer than\\nhis sister’s. He wasn’t crying though. He was fuming.\\n\\nLooking at Charlie for direction, he just shrugged at me with a look of sadness\\nfrom his own big blue eyes. Leading them out I said, “I think it may be best if\\nyou both come out of the room now. This is not helping anyone, especially your\\nfather”. With tea made, we sat in the kitchen and I listened to them talk.\\nMaryanne didn’t have so much to say and when I asked her why, she said it\\nwasn’t worth the hassle. Underneath the hurtful words between them though, I\\ncould still see love. Thinking back to how honesty had begun repairing my own\\nfamily situation, I encouraged them to talk.\\n\\nMy relationship with my father for example, had once been tumultuous and\\nvery painful for me. But with honesty, compassion, and time, it had healed\\nbeautifully. We were now enjoying a very respectful, humorous, and loving\\nfriendship. There was a time I would have never dreamed it possible, but any\\nfamily relationship can be healed, if love still remains and both parties are\\nwilling, as it was for us. It was obvious that love still existed between Greg and\\nMaryanne, as did a yearning to be understood by each other. It was all just\\ndistorted by pain.\\n\\nAfter they had both shared their grievances, I asked what they liked about each\\nother. “Nothin’,” Greg replied gruffly. I lightened the situation with humour and\\nbefore long he came up with a couple of things. Maryanne likewise named a few\\nthings. Their egos were battling with this, particularly Greg’s, as he wanted to\\nhate her. What drove me to suggest this though, was that it had worked for me\\nwhen thinking of some of my own family members. During those years when\\nthings became the most painful in my relationships with them, I tried to draw on\\nthings I liked or loved about them. I was the same as Greg at first, struggling to\\n\\x0ccome up with anything. But it was only my pain talking, blinding me from\\nseeing good things in them. When I let go of that, I saw that even though our\\nlifestyle differences may never see us sharing especially close connections, they\\nwere all decent, good-hearted people.\\n\\nI was able to recall things they had done with kind intentions in the past.\\nWhile some of these were unfortunately used against me later, the initial\\nintentions had been kind. There were also occasions I could recognise now\\nwhen, in their own individual ways, they had tried to show me their love. But I\\nhad been so wounded myself that I had rebuked it, pushing it away. They were\\nall beautiful people underneath any misunderstandings though, as everyone is\\nunderneath the stuff that clouds one’s best self. So today, it was just Greg and\\nMaryanne’s turn, to work through some of their disagreements.\\n\\nIt turned out that Greg had carried resentment for his sister for decades, simply\\nbecause she had had the courage to live the life she had been guided to, the life\\nshe wanted. It wasn’t Maryanne who had stopped Greg doing this for himself\\nalso though. It was Greg. A great deal of emotions came out that afternoon and\\nwhile they were certainly not best friends by the end of the day, they were much\\nfurther along than at the start. Each of them then spent some individual time in\\nwith Charlie before they headed off. Then it was just Charlie and I again.\\n\\nWalking back into his room after they had left, he looked at me shaking his\\nhead and laughing gently. “Well my dear girl. That one has been building for\\nabout twenty years now. I had always wondered when the volcano would blow,”\\nhe chuckled. “I am glad it has happened now before I go, maybe I will see them\\nbecome friends after all.”\\n\\nBirds were singing in the native trees out the window and an orange butterfly\\nflew by. We both watched it, smiling, and then went back to chatting. Charlie\\ntold me how they had always been very close as children, Greg always looking\\nout for his little sister and her idolising him. When she became an independently\\nthinking teenager though, they had begun fighting and never found their\\ncloseness again.\\n\\n“Tt’s not Maryanne I worry about though Bronnie. She is relatively happy. It is\\nGreg. He has never stopped trying to prove himself. When he says he always did\\nmore for me than Maryanne, he is right in some ways, although she has helped\\ngreatly in other less obvious ways. But he didn’t have to. Most of the time, he\\nwas doing things I could still do myself, and would have actually liked to.”\\nSighing, Charlie went on. “He works ridiculous hours in a job he hates, raising\\nchildren who never see him, and I don’t really know why.”\\n\\x0c“Does he know you love him Charlie?” I asked with dare. He looked at me\\npuzzled.\\n\\n“Well, I suppose so. I always comment if he’s done a good job here, around\\nthe house. He knows I am proud of him.”\\n\\n“How? Do you ever tell him directly that you are proud of who he is as a\\nperson, rather than of the job he’s done?” I asked.\\n\\nHe paused for a moment. “Not directly, no. But he knows,” Charlie replied.\\n\\n“How?” I persisted.\\n\\nCharlie laughed. “You damn women. You have to get to the depth of it all,\\ndon’t you?” Laughing, I then shared my thoughts with Charlie. He listened\\nrespectfully and openly. I wondered if what he had said about Greg always\\ntrying to prove himself, was actually due to him seeking his dad’s love and\\napproval. The conversation continued as I showered Charlie then wheeled him\\nback to bed. He always preferred an afternoon shower, but it was starting to\\nexhaust him and before long, it would be bed baths only. His breathing was poor\\nand it took some time for him to get it regular again once back in bed. He was\\nbecoming a little frailer each day. So I left him to rest.\\n\\nPoking my head back in a couple of hours later, he turned to me and smiled.\\nSo I sat beside the bed, assisted him to have a drink, and asked if he needed\\nanything else. He shook his head then continued to talk about his children. “All I\\nwant for them is to be happy. That’s all any parent should want of their children.\\nI wish Greg would stop working so hard by making his life simpler. He is a good\\nman, but he is not happy in himself,” he told me. “The simple life is the happy\\nlife. It is how their mother and I always lived. We didn’t really have a choice\\nthough. It was hard then. But simplicity is still possible today. It is a good\\nchoice.”\\n\\nA photo of Charlie as a dashing young man standing beside his bride, sat in the\\ncentre position on the mantelpiece in his room. I thought of him and his wife\\nraising Greg and Maryanne as infants. Charlie was a straight talker and I liked\\nthat about him. There was something very old-fashioned about his honesty. He\\ncontinued to share whatever came to mind as he thought out loud. “You know, I\\ndon’t think he truly knows I love him. I’ve never said the words exactly.”\\n\\n“We are all different, Charlie,” I said. “Some people know through actions but\\nmost people need to actually hear it. Perhaps Greg is one of these kinds of\\npeople. What is it going to hurt anyway, by you telling him?”\\n\\nHe nodded. “I do need to tell him. What a terrible world we live in when a\\nseventy-eight year old man is nervous about telling his son he loves him. I’ve\\n\\x0chad no practice in this you know,” he laughed. But seriousness came to his face.\\nThe look of a clear decision and determination became obvious. Charlie\\ncontinued. “Do you think I might be able to convince him to live a simpler life if\\nhe is not trying to seek my approval anymore, if he knows I love him? And I do\\nlove him.”\\n\\nI said to Charlie that no one could determine how another will react. There\\nwere no guarantees this would change Greg’s lifestyle. The important thing was\\nthat it was likely to bring him more peace by knowing he had his dad’s love and\\napproval.\\n\\nThe topic of living simply became more of an important issue for Charlie, as\\nhis days wore on. He said people work too hard for all sorts of reasons. Often\\nthey think there is no choice, because they cannot get off the wheel of routine\\nwith bills and supporting their family. Charlie understood this. He agreed that\\nsurvival is a genuine challenge for many people, but insisted there were always\\nchoices. “It is a matter of changing your perspective sometimes. Do we really\\nneed to live in a house this big? Do we need such a flashy car?” he asked.\\nSometimes, he said, it was more a matter of changing their thinking and finding\\na new solution, thinking hard about what they love and working as a family\\ntowards finding more balance.\\n\\nCommunity was also a way towards simplicity, Charlie explained. If we work\\ntogether more as a community, we don’t need as many resources. There is less\\nwaste and we learn to help each other out. Ego and pride stop many communities\\nfrom ever being born or developed, he said. But if we want to live more\\nresourcefully and more simply, it is important to start understanding the huge\\nimportance and need of community in the area we live in. He was sad that times\\nhad become so fast and unbalanced that we had forgotten this.\\n\\nCharlie acknowledged that it could be very difficult financially in these times.\\nHe said society had lost sight of true priorities, and it was society itself that\\nneeded a lesson in simplicity. But this only ever happens by individuals\\nchanging themselves first, one person at a time. Then eventually society will\\nfollow the way the majority thinks and lives, as it always does. He also believed\\nthose in power needed a good kick in the pants. There were some good people\\ndotted throughout the political systems of the world. But they too were often\\nrestricted by red tape, and by others with more money and power. So to make a\\nsignificant change, every single one of us had a job to do. Simplifying our lives\\nwas a very good place to start.\\n\\nCharlie had raised a family of his own, so he fully understood the pressure of\\n\\x0csurvival and supporting a family. But he was also dying and now saw things\\nfrom a different perspective, wishing out loud that he had realised all of this\\nsooner, so he could have guided Greg differently. “Children are happier having\\nmore time with their parents than having more toys. They may complain at first.\\nBut the happiest children are those who get quality time with their parents, both\\nparents if possible. Young boys too need more male influence. How can Greg’s\\nboys get that if he is working all of the time, trying to prove himself?” Charlie\\nsat thoughtfully, as I saw new insights registering in him. “I do love my boy. I\\nneed to tell him, don’t I?”\\n\\nWith happiness, I nodded. Then, out of the blue he asked, “Is your life\\nsimple?” to which I laughed gently.\\n\\n“Yes, my physical life is quite simple Charlie. And I am working on\\nsimplifying my emotional life, one step at a time,” I replied honestly, still\\nlaughing a little as I thought about the complications of my emotional life in\\nrecent years, something that had been far from simple. “Meditation had helped\\nme hugely to simplify my thinking. All of my life benefits from this in one way\\nor another. It has truly transformed me, allowing me to move through a lot of\\nstuff that used to hold me back. So my thinking is much, much simpler these\\ndays. And yes, my physical life is pretty simple too.”\\n\\nCharlie was from a different lifestyle and generation, so didn’t know anything\\nabout meditation, other than people overseas in orange robes sat with their eyes\\nclosed. He asked me what it was. I explained it as simply as possible, telling\\nCharlie that by learning to focus the mind, we become better able to observe our\\nown thinking. From this it becomes clear just how much of life is shaped by a\\nmind running wild on its own, creating unnecessary suffering and fears. As these\\nunhealthy thinking patterns grow and intensify, we become identified with this\\npersonality as being who we are and shaping our lives around that. When\\nactually, we are not this, but so much more.\\n\\nWe are wise, intuitive beings who have become blinded by the fears and\\nmisperceptions our minds have created over the years, through all of its\\nreactions, both positive and negative. So by learning to focus our minds in\\nmeditation, say by observing our breath for an easy example, we begin to take\\nback ownership of our own thinking, thus giving ourselves the choice to\\nconsciously think better thoughts. And therefore, create happier lives.\\n\\nCharlie sat speechless, staring at me. I smiled waiting. “Wow,” he finally said.\\n“Why didn’t I meet you fifty years ago?” Laughing, I hopped up and gave him\\nanother sip of his drink.\\n\\x0c“Why didn’t I meet me years ago too Charlie?” I laughed. “It would have\\nsaved me a lot of pain!”\\n\\nThe conversation continued and eventually turned to him asking me about the\\nsimplicity of my physical life, and what I had meant by that. After many years of\\nmoving, I told him, I had started to question the importance of belongings. With\\nsome moves, my furniture came with me. At other times, it was stored either for\\nfree on family farms, or in a shed I had to pay for. Whenever I was living a\\nchapter free of those belongings, I was reminded of how much I didn’t need any\\nof it to be happy. I would question why I was keeping it at all.\\n\\nSo my furniture was sold, reducing my belongings to just household goods,\\nenabling me to set up again somewhere else when the time came. And the time\\nwould come again, as I always loved my own kitchen space. Drifting suited me.\\nThere was a great freedom in it. But even freedom has its price. Everything has a\\nprice. Missing my own kitchen was what usually made me want to settle again\\nfor a time.\\n\\nYet after then settling for twelve to eighteen months, I would be missing the\\nexcitement of leaping out into the unknown all over again. Owning things would\\nleave me feeling terribly weighed down. So recognising my own patterns, I came\\nto accept that for these years in my life, I would actually be better off if I owned\\nnothing much at all. Each time I had started again, furniture had come my way\\neasily, through word-of-mouth, second hands shops and yard sales. I loved that.\\nBuying second hand things was also more conducive to my love of the Earth, as\\nit asked no more if its diminishing resources. Our throw-away society seems to\\nforget that everything new has to come from somewhere, and everything old has\\nto end up somewhere. In most cases, it is the Earth that has to bear the burden at\\nboth ends. This comes at a dangerous price for the planet’s survival and that of\\nall of its creatures, we humans included.\\n\\nAs it was, they were always fascinating things I ended up with, creating a\\nwhole new home. It never occurred to me that the furniture would not come. So\\nas a result, it always did and very easily. I’ve owned some gorgeous pieces over\\nthe years. If the furniture came my way so naturally each time I settled, then\\nsurely everything else would too.\\n\\nHaving paid storage on my belongings for the previous twelve months, I\\ndecided this was a waste of money and an encumbrance I didn’t need. So with\\nthe help of a beautiful and dependable friend, we set up a garage sale at his\\nplace. Cutlery, books, floor rugs, linen, ornaments, paintings, everything went. It\\nwas such a fun time, watching the excitement of people, as my things became\\n\\x0ctheir new belongings and bargains. Whatever remained was taken to the charity\\nshop that afternoon.\\n\\nBy now I was driving a car the size of a shoebox. The jeep had exited life in\\nspectacular fashion a year or so earlier on a six-lane highway. The current car,\\nwhile incredibly economical and nippy around the cities, was tiny. It was\\naffectionately known as ‘the rice bubble’. So the intention of the garage sale was\\nto own no more afterwards than would fit inside the rice bubble.\\n\\nA total of five boxes remained. Two boxes of my favourite books were\\nincluded. I only kept those that I knew I would read again, or ones I would lend\\nor give to others for inspiration. The rest of the books found themselves in new\\nhands to be enjoyed again elsewhere. The remainder of the boxes contained\\nCDs, journals, photo albums, a few small things of sentiment, the patchwork\\nquilt my mother made me, and my clothing. Then with the rice bubble packed to\\nthe max and the stereo on, I headed off into another period of my life.\\n\\nThe music that accompanied me contained songs from Guy Clark, The Waifs,\\nBen Lee, David Hosking, Cyndi Boste, Shawn Mullins, Mary Chapin Carpenter,\\nFred Eaglesmith, Abba, The Waterboys, JJ Cale, Sara Tindley, Karl Broadie,\\nJohn Prine, Heather Nova, David Francey, Lucinda Williams, Yusuf, and The\\nOzark Mountain Daredevils. It was all brilliant music, each song proving to be a\\nfabulous travelling companion. I sang happily and freely as the miles unfolded,\\nknowing that all of my belongings in the world were there with me in the rice\\nbubble. About a thousand kilometers away, I stopped at my folk’s place and\\noffloaded the boxes. After that, it was just my clothes and I.\\n\\nCharlie listened with delight, rubbing his old, weathered hands together in joy\\nat my story. I then shared how after that trip, I had drifted for a while. Now I was\\nin Sydney, experiencing the life of a house-sitter extraordinaire and that indeed,\\nmy physical life was actually quite a simple one. He knew then that I understood\\nwhat he was trying to say about the importance of simplicity. We agreed that it is\\nnot always obvious to people just how much having excess belongings can\\nweigh them down, even if they have no intentions of moving on. Clearing out\\nphysical belongings always leaves a person feeling more spacious within as well.\\n\\nGreg arrived the next day and spent the whole time in with his father. At\\nCharlie’s request, I had phoned Maryanne and asked her not to visit today.\\nTomorrow it would be the other way around. Maryanne would have her father all\\nto herself and Greg would not be visiting. Charlie had asked me earlier to\\ndiscreetly pop in now and then in case things were awkward between him and\\nGreg, my presence hopefully altering this. But there was no need. The couple of\\n\\x0ctimes I did go in there, to deliver a pot of tea or pass on a message, it was\\nobvious that an important personal discussion and sharing was underway.\\n\\nNot long before Greg was due to leave, so his dad could rest, they called me\\nin. Greg’s eyes were bloodshot from crying and they were holding each other’s\\nhand. “Bronnie, I just want you to know too,” Charlie announced. “I love this\\nman with all of my heart. He is a good son and a great man.”\\n\\nAt this of course I almost cried. “My son is already enough,” Charlie said.\\n“There is nothing for him to prove. There is nothing he needs to do or to have, to\\nbecome a better person. I love this man sitting here completely. And being his\\nfather has brought my life great joy.”\\n\\nThrough my laughing smile, I said that Greg was blessed to have Charlie as\\nhis dad too. Greg agreed, using his whole sleeve to wipe his tears. “And Dad\\nreckons I could learn a thing or two from you about simplicity,” he announced.\\n\\nLaughing, I replied that his dad still had enough time left to leave his own\\nmark on Greg in that regard. He didn’t need me to do the job for him. But as a\\ndeparting remark, I said with a smile, “All I will add though, is keep it simple”.\\n\\nMaryanne came around the next day. I heard her laughing and crying with her\\ndad as well. There was a lot of love being shared in this household and I couldn’t\\nhelp but be affected by it positively. During the next few weeks, the three of\\nthem spent a lot of time together and grew much closer. Never did I hear Charlie\\nsay goodbye without telling them both individually that he loved them, and they\\nboth said the same to him. The channel of communication had been opened in\\ntime for healing to happen, while Charlie was still alive.\\n\\nOn the day of his passing, Greg and Maryanne sat holding one of their dad’s\\nhands each. At their request, I sat in the room too as he slipped away peacefully,\\nhis breathing slowing until it ceased completely. It was a clear morning and birds\\ncontinued to sing outside his window as they always had. I thought how it added\\nbeauty to the occasion. They were singing him on.\\n\\nLeaving Greg and Maryanne alone then, I sat out on the verandah for a while,\\nenjoying my own memories of Charlie and sending him prayers and good wishes\\non the road ahead, wherever he now was. When I came inside again, Greg and\\nMaryanne were sitting on the same side of the bed, holding hands as they looked\\nat their dad, laughing and smiling through tears, speaking of him with joy.\\n\\nAbout a year later I received an email from Greg. He and his family had sold\\ntheir big home. He had taken a transfer with the company he was working for,\\nwas earning less money, but was now living in a small country town. He\\ncommuted to work the same distance as before. But it was now on a country\\n\\x0croad to a bigger country town and took him less than half the time of his\\nprevious commuting. This gave him an extra one and a half hours a day with his\\nchildren. The cost of living was also less as their lives had become simpler. Yet\\ntheir quality of life had improved enormously. His wife was happy too and they\\nall loved their new friends and lifestyle. He thanked me for looking after their\\nfather and spoke lovingly of Maryanne, who apparently had just been there\\nvisiting.\\n\\nUnderstandably, the email brought me much joy. It took me back to Charlie,\\nhis blue eyes, delightful smile, and the conversations we had shared. Knowing\\nthat his words had not only been heard, but also applied, was also a wonderful\\nfeeling.\\n\\nThe very best of the email though was how Greg had signed off. After wishing\\nme well in my own life, he summed things up with three little words, leaving me\\nwith a huge smile across my face.\\n\\nKeep it Simple.\\n\\nIndeed, Greg and Charlie. Indeed.\\n\\x0cREGRET 3:\\nI WISH ’D HAD THE COURAGE TO\\nEXPRESS MY FEELINGS\\n\\netexon9\\n\\nFor a ninety-four year old man who was dying, Jozsef looked remarkably well\\nwhen we first met. He was a gentle person with a lovely smile that made him\\nlook like a young boy at times. With his quiet but very quick sense of humour, I\\nwarmed to him straight away.\\n\\nJozsef’s family has decided not to tell him he was dying. I found this difficult\\nbut tried to respect their decision, as much as possible. Over the next few weeks\\nhowever, his illness took a drastic turn downhill, which was impossible to\\nignore. Standing unaided became a thing of the past. With each new day, he\\ndepended on my strength more and more. His illness was not something that\\nneeded to be pointed out. It was obvious every time he tried to stand or sit, and it\\nwas something that was silently registered between us with each effort. So while\\nthe family continued the charade of not telling him he was dying, Jozsef’s own\\nrealisation was setting in. He was indeed a very ill man.\\n\\nMedications were used to compensate his pain as much as possible. But as was\\nthe case with many people, the side-effects of the medications were blocked up\\nbowels. There are drugs to then compensate for that, but they were not working\\nwell in Jozsef’s case. So I was required to assist with bowel discharge by\\ninserting medication into his rectum, the poor old fellow. Once you are this ill,\\nthere is no privacy anymore. Certainly there was no dignity now, as Jozsef rolled\\nonto his side for me to insert the small tube. I tried to keep the situation light of\\ncourse and found myself speaking words I would hear me saying regularly to\\nothers later.\\n\\n“Tt all starts off being about food and poo Jozsef, and it all ends up being about\\nfood and poo,” I gently joked with him. Working with the dying truly brought\\nhome to me the cycles of life. The things that keep a baby most comfortable at\\nthe very beginning are food and the release of their bowels and wind. At the end\\nof life, the questions everyone asks of the dying person are if they are still eating\\n\\x0cand are their bowels working properly.\\n\\nIt is a relief to everyone when someone who is dying and is on strong\\npainkillers, finally manages a bowel movement, easing this other pain. So was\\nthe case for Jozsef and his family, when he made a dash to the toilet soon after\\nand enjoyed an explosion from his bum. Of course this brought me relief too, not\\nonly because my client was more comfortable, but also that I had succeeded in\\nthis procedure on my first ever attempt.\\n\\nOne of his sons lived in a nearby suburb and visited daily. Another lived\\ninterstate. His daughter lived overseas. Each day Jozsef and his son would chat\\nfor a little while, mostly about the business pages of the newspaper, until Jozsef\\nbecame too tired. This was not long as his health was deteriorating so quickly. I\\nliked his son, though didn’t feel a strong connection with him. I had no reason\\nnot to like him though. When I mentioned to Jozsef later that his son was a nice\\nman, he replied with, “He is only interested in my money”. Preferring to take\\npeople as I find them, I tried to keep this comment from influencing my own\\nopinion of his son.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks my client shared many stories with me, mostly about\\nthe love of his work. He and his wife Gizela had been holocaust survivors,\\nmanaging to find their way to Australia upon their release. Stories about his time\\nin the camps came out in fragments. But I didn’t push it. I was there to listen but\\nnot determine what he wanted to share. It was obvious that life was easier for\\nboth of them by not discussing it. Trying to empathise as much as possible with\\nthe situation, I hated to think how much pain they were each carrying and my\\nheart went out to them.\\n\\nJozsef and I fell into an easy association, and stories on other subjects flowed\\nwell. We had similar senses of humour and were both fairly quiet natured. So we\\nliked each other. The generation gap made little difference as we came to share a\\nstrong conversational flow, one that strengthened daily. All the while, Gizela\\nwould come in with food constantly encouraging Jozsef to eat. She was a great\\ncook, but though he was hardly able to eat at all by now, she still cooked huge\\nquantities. A part of this was possibly habit, but a part of it was denial.\\n\\nThe family had somehow also convinced Jozsef’s doctor not to tell him that he\\nwas dying. It was a mass denial. But not only were they not telling him the truth\\nabout this condition and inevitable decline, the family were trying to convince\\nhim he was getting better. “Come on Jozsef, eat up. You’ll be getting better in no\\ntime,” Gizela would say repeatedly. My heart felt for her too. To be so scared of\\nthe truth must have been a huge burden to bear.\\n\\x0cBy this time, Jozsef was down to just a tub of yoghurt a day and was\\nincredibly weak, no longer even able to walk to the lounge room with assistance,\\nbut they were still telling him he would be better in no time. I stayed silent on\\nthe topic until Jozsef brought it up with me directly.\\n\\nGizela had just left the room. Jozsef was sitting back and I was giving him a\\nfoot massage, something he had never had in his life but had grown accustomed\\nto with great delight over the previous weeks. I loved pampering my clients and\\nperhaps this is why we grew close. A lot of the conversations I had with them\\nwere while I was massaging feet, brushing hair, scratching backs or filing their\\nnails.\\n\\n“T am dying, aren’t I Bronnie?” he said when she was out of the room.\\n\\nI looked at him with kindness and nodded. “Yes Jozsef, you are.”\\n\\nHe nodded with the relief of being told the truth. After my experience with\\nStella’s family, there was no way I was going to be anything but honest from\\nhere on. He looked out the window for some time, the foot massage continued in\\ncomfortable silence.\\n\\n“Thank you. Thank you for telling me the truth,” he finally replied in his thick\\naccent. I smiled gently and nodded. Silence lingered for a moment or two. Then\\nhe spoke again. “They just can’t handle it,” he said of his family. “Gizela can’t\\nface the pain of talking with me about it. She will be OK. She just can’t talk\\nabout it.”\\n\\nHe was peaceful in knowing his situation and I was peaceful in having been\\nhonest. He continued, “I don’t have long left, do I?”\\n\\n“T don’t think so Jozsef.”\\n\\n“Weeks, months?” he questioned.\\n\\n“T really don’t know. But I would guess it is only weeks or days. That’s my\\nfeeling, but I really don’t know,” I told him honestly. He nodded and looked out\\nthe window again.\\n\\nVery few people can truly predict exactly when someone is going to pass,\\nunless the person is obviously in their last few days. But it was a question clients\\nand families always asked, sometimes repeatedly. By now I was starting to\\ngauge the decline of people, also seeing how quickly things could change. Often\\nclients would appear to pick up again briefly, before the final turn home. The\\nsuccess of my role as a carer really came down to me working intuitively. It was\\non that basis I had answered Jozsef’s question, even if somewhat reluctantly. I\\njust didn’t want to lie and say he had months left when there was no way he did.\\n\\nThe foot massage was finished and I sat looking out the window too. He broke\\n\\x0cthe silence after a time. “I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.” Waiting I let him\\ncontinue. “I loved my work, I really loved it. That’s why I worked so hard, that\\nand to provide for my family and their family.”\\n\\n“Well that’s a beautiful thing then. So why regret it?”\\n\\nHe explained that his regrets were partly for his family, who had seen so little\\nof him for most of their life in Australia. But it was mostly because he felt he\\nhad never given them a chance to know him. “I was too scared to let my feelings\\nshow. So I worked and worked and kept the family at a distance. They didn’t\\ndeserve to be so alone. Now I wish they really knew me.”\\n\\nJoszef said he hadn’t really known himself until recent years, so questioned\\nhow they could have stood a chance of knowing him anyway. His lovely eyes\\nwere Sad as we talked about the patterns of relationships and how difficult it is to\\nbreak those. We also discussed how necessary it is for a relationship to reach its\\ngreatest potential. He also felt he had missed the opportunity to create loving\\nwarmth with his children. The only example he had ever set was how to earn and\\nvalue money. “What is the point of that now?” he sighed.\\n\\n“Well,” I tried to reason. “You have done what you intended. You are leaving\\nthem with a comfortable life. You have provided for them as you wanted to.”\\n\\nA solitary tear ran down his cheek. “But they don’t know me. They don’t\\nknow me.” I looked at him lovingly. “And I want them to,” he said, as the tears\\nstarted to flow. I sat in silence as he cried.\\n\\nAfter a while I suggested it wasn’t too late. But he disagreed. He was too frail\\nto speak for long periods now, so that alone would have made it difficult. He also\\nadmitted to not knowing how to talk with them about such depth of feelings. So I\\noffered to go and get Gizela and his son, to include them in the current\\nconversation, saying it may be easier with me there perhaps. But he shook his\\nhead and dried his tears. “No. It is too late. Let’s not tell them I know. It is easier\\nfor them thinking the way they do. I know I am dying. It is OK.”\\n\\nJozsef was near the age my own dear grandmother was when she had passed\\non. Although each of their lives had been vastly different, there was something\\nabout being with someone of this age I was comfortable with. My Gran and I\\nused to be able to talk about death very easily though. She said it was easier with\\nme than with some of her own children.\\n\\nShe and her twin brother had been the eldest of eleven children. Gran was only\\nthirteen when her mother died, and raised all of the other children herself. Her\\nfather was a ‘hard man’, as she put it. She also called him a ‘mongrel’ at other\\ntimes. He provided food but little else, especially not love, she said.\\n\\x0cA year or so after her mother had died the youngest of her siblings also passed\\naway, a little one called Charlotte. Then after raising all of those younger\\nsiblings, Gran went onto raise seven children of her own, my mother included.\\nWhen I was born with a mass of dark curls and big inquisitive eyes, Gran saw a\\nspitting image of Charlotte in me. As a result, we shared a close connection from\\nmy first day.\\n\\nWe would all be so excited when she came to visit us. Kids love visitors and\\nwe were no different. Gran stood no taller than five feet, but was a dynamic,\\namazing woman. She’d had to be with her upbringing. The love she gave me\\nwas unconditional and always totally accepting. A fine example of this, amongst\\nmany, was when my mother was overseas with her own twin sister, having a\\nwell-deserved holiday. My father worked away a few days a week, so Gran came\\nto look after us.\\n\\nI was twelve at the time, soon to be thirteen and in my first year of high school\\nat the convent. The school was hidden behind ten-foot double-brick walls and\\nrun by nuns, some of who were lovely women. The head mistress though was a\\ntough cookie and not so affectionately known as ‘Iron Face’. The older students\\nhad warned us off her from Day One. Although now as a grown woman, and not\\ninfluenced by such rumours, I admit she may possibly have been a lovely\\nwoman underneath that tough exterior. I want to believe that anyway. But she ran\\na tight ship and in my years there, I must say, I didn’t see her smile once.\\n\\nIn that first year of high school, there was obviously a part of me looking for\\nsomething different and I found myself hanging out with two of the toughest\\ngirls in the class for a short while. I was a pretty good kid and had been rarely\\nnoticed by the head mistress prior to this, which suited me just fine.\\n\\nClimbing a tree and sneaking over the fence in our lunch break, we raced\\ndowntown and made our way into a store where we each stole a pair of earrings,\\nwith our initials on them. Gaining confidence from such easy success, we then\\nventured into the next store and shoplifted some lip-gloss. Rubbing my sweet\\ntasting lips together and laughing at how good the stuff was, I felt a large hand\\non my shoulder with a voice saying, “Ill have that thank you”.\\n\\nWith legs almost paralysed in fear, I was led into the store manager’s office\\nwith one of the other girls. The other had run off. They called the head mistress\\nof the school, who was then waiting for us on our humble return. She tapped the\\nruler into her hand. “Into my office,” she stated firmly.\\n\\n“Yes Sister,” we said humbly in unison. If we had tails, they would have been\\nbetween our legs by this time.\\n\\x0cThe deal the store did with the school was that no charges would be laid. But\\nwe had to go home and tell our parents ourselves what we had done. The parents\\nwere then required to call the head mistress and confirm we had told them. We\\nwere also banned from sport for a whole term and being mad sports lovers, this\\ndevastated to us both. Being hit across the backs of our legs with the ruler a\\ndozen times was endured too. She was a tough woman.\\n\\nWith Mum overseas and Dad home for the end of the week, I was terrified.\\nDue to being a sensitive, gentle kid, I was already scared of anyone with a big\\nvoice. But Gran was there too, so I took her aside. With a big bottom lip\\ntrembling, I told her what I had done. She sat listening, not interrupting, not\\nreacting. She waited until I was finished, by which time I was bawling my eyes\\nout.\\n\\n“Well, are you going to do it again?” she asked.\\n\\n“No Gran. I promise,” I solemnly declared.\\n\\n“Have you learnt your lesson here?”\\n\\nI assured her, “Yes Gran, I have. I won’t do it again”.\\n\\n“OK,” she finally said. “Well, let’s not tell your father and I will ring the\\nschool for you tomorrow.” And that was it. Bless her. But the fear I had\\nexperienced from the incident itself was so enormous and enough that not only\\ndid I never shoplift again, I was never even capable of returning to that particular\\nstore.\\n\\nYears later when high school was completed, I left the country town I grew up\\nin. Not able to wait to spread my wings I accepted the first job offered, a banking\\nrole near Gran’s place in the city, five hours away. Living with my Gran and aunt\\nwas the most practical option.\\n\\nAt eighteen, fresh off the farm and out of convent schooling, it was not\\nsurprising I was open to new opportunities. When my mother guessed later that\\nyear I was no longer a virgin, she was horrified and almost ready to disown me,\\nunable to believe that me, a good girl with common sense, could be so easily\\nswayed. It was Gran who fixed things again, telling my mum to lighten up as\\ntimes had changed and that I was still a good girl in my own way. My\\nconnection with both of these wonderful women continued to strengthen from\\nthat point on.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the world of alcohol and came home drunk to Gran’s, it\\nwas she who left a bucket beside the bed, just in case. She was wise, accepting\\nand a hugely positive role in my life. She was also relieved when I announced at\\na reasonably young age that alcohol was just not for me.\\n\\x0cGran outlived all of her brothers and sisters, which was heartbreaking for her\\nas they had been like her own children. We would write to each other from\\nwherever I was living and share our lives as an open book. I shared her sadness\\nof losing her last sister and her frustrations in growing older, gradually losing her\\nindependence. Seeing her slow down over the years was heartbreaking for me\\ntoo, as I had to face the fact that she wasn’t going to be around forever.\\n\\nI started to find it hard to hold back the tears whenever we would talk. So I\\nopenly told her how much I loved her and how much I was going to miss her\\nwhen her time came. After that, we were able to speak about death with candid\\nhonesty. I am so glad we did. With no denial of what lay ahead, we savoured\\nevery conversation we had and she was able to share her thoughts about passing\\nwith me. Gran was ready to go for years before she did.\\n\\nReturning from a few years overseas, I couldn’t wait to see her. The changes\\nwere huge. With hair now totally white, she walked with a stick and had shrunk\\neven more. My Gran was now an old, old lady. She was in her nineties, but still\\nthe amazing woman I knew. Her mind was clear and our conversations continued\\non with great satisfaction for another year or so.\\n\\nThe phone call came on a Monday while I was at work in one of my last bank\\njobs, managing the local branch. She had passed away the night before, dying in\\nher sleep. My world fell out beneath me and I shut the office door. With my head\\nbetween my arms on the desk, I sobbed in farewell to my beloved, darling\\ngrandmother and for my loss. “Oh Gran, oh Gran, oh Gran,” I cried into my own\\narms.\\n\\nLeaving work early, bleary eyed and too sad to think clearly, I stopped at the\\nmailbox. Flicking through the letters and bills half numb, I halted in amazement.\\nThere amongst them was a card from my little Gran. She had posted it Friday\\nand had died naturally in her sleep on Sunday night. A torrent of tears flowed\\nfrom both sorrow and joy as I held the card to my heart, sobbing but almost\\nlaughing at the same time.\\n\\nI was so grateful for the connection we had shared and for having had the\\nhonesty to talk about death with her. There was nothing left unsaid. She knew I\\nloved her and I knew she loved me, even more so as I read the beautiful words\\nshe had written — “I love you dearly my Darling. You are so often in my\\nthoughts. May sunshine follow you all the days of your life Bron. Love Gran.”\\n\\nThe thought of her dying may have brought me tears before her departure. I\\ncertainly cried after the event. But there was peace too, knowing we had faced\\nwhat inevitably happens to everyone, with honesty and openness. That peace\\n\\x0cstays with me still. Her face smiles back at me from a photo frame on my desk.\\nWhile there are days I miss her dearly these years on, I have no doubt that\\nhonesty gave us a relationship so special and positive that it continues to shape\\nme in the best possible ways.\\n\\nIt wasn’t so easy for my dear client Jozsef though. The honesty was now too\\npainful for him and his family. My heart went out to him as I felt his pain and\\nfrustration. What that dear man must have experienced in his life, I still hated to\\nimagine. Gizela continued to come in with enormous meals, encouraging Jozsef\\nto eat up. He would smile gently at her and decline the meal each time. Other\\ncarers came in of an evening, but I was the main day carer. We knew each other\\nand it was comfortable and easy for him, especially now he was able to open up,\\nat least to me.\\n\\nIt was with surprise and sadness then when I learned I was being replaced. His\\nson had been complaining of the costs of care. Explaining to his son that his\\nfather only had a matter of a week or two left, he chose to make other plans\\nanyway, saying Jozsef could live on for ages. Finding an illegal worker willing\\nto do the job for next to nothing was the solution.\\n\\nPleading with Gizela to convince their son otherwise, it was no use. Their\\nminds were made up. There was other work waiting for me elsewhere. That\\nwasn’t the issue. It was that Jozsef had finally been able to talk and he was\\ncomfortable with me. Surely his happiness should have been the priority for the\\nlast week or two of his life. I hated to think of how impersonal the alternative\\nmight be, especially as he was no longer able to speak a lot due to weakness and\\nbreathing difficulties. I felt for the new carer too, and the language difficulties\\nthey would face together.\\n\\nBut it was out of my hands and I had to trust that these events were also a part\\nof Jozsef’s life journey. How can any of us know what another is here to learn?\\nWe can’t. So with a hug, and a smile that said more than words were ever going\\nto, we said our goodbye. Pausing at the doorway of his room one last time, I\\nlooked at him again. We each smiled the same way at each other, saying nothing\\nbut saying so much. Then it was time to go. Driving away from his home,\\nknowing he would be staring out of the window in his own thoughts by now, my\\ntears flowed. This role was exposing me to people I would have never met\\notherwise and I loved what was shared and learned through each other, as hard\\nas it sometimes was.\\n\\nJozsef’s granddaughter called me about a week later to tell me he had died the\\nnight before. I was glad for him. His illness would never have allowed him any\\n\\x0cmore quality of life anyway. It was for the best. Contemplating all that had\\nunfolded, I found only blessings. Learning through these dear people before they\\ndied was a rare gift and for that I was grateful. We will all die, but this work was\\nreminding me we all have a choice too, on how to live in the meantime.\\n\\nSeeing the anguish Jozsef experienced in not being able to express his feelings\\nleft me determined to always try and be brave enough to share mine. My walls of\\nprivacy were being eroded and I began to wonder why we are all so afraid of\\nbeing open and honest. Of course, it is to avoid pain that may come as a result of\\nour honesty. But those walls we create bring pain of their own, by stopping\\nothers from knowing who we truly are. Watching the tears fall down that lovely\\nold man’s face, as he longed to be known and understood, changed me forever.\\n\\nAfter receiving the phone call about Jozsef’s passing, I sat in a park near the\\nbeach just absorbing the surroundings. Children were playing everywhere and I\\nwatched how naturally they all shared their feelings. If they liked someone, they\\nsaid so. If they were sad, they cried, released it, and were then happy again. They\\ndidn’t know how to suppress their feelings. It was beautiful to watch the honest\\nexpressions. It was also refreshing to see how they all played and worked on\\nthings together.\\n\\nWe have created a society where adults are now so insular and apart. Working\\ntogether, expressing their feelings, and being joyous were the natural states of\\nthe children I watched. While it made me sad that as adults we have lost such\\nability to be so totally open, it also brought me hope. If we were once also like\\nthat, as we all would have been to varying degrees, then perhaps we could learn\\nto be that way again.\\n\\nI made a clear decision in the park there by the beach. I was not going to find\\nmyself ever regretting things as dear Jozsef had. It was time to be more\\ncourageous and to start expressing my feelings more.\\n\\nThe walls around my heart were of no use anymore. The process of\\ndismantling them was at last, now underway.\\n\\x0cNO GUILT\\neter\\n\\nThe buzzer rang, bringing me out of a snug sleep in my latest abode. Slipping\\nsome cover on my feet and wrapping myself in a robe, I headed upstairs to\\nattend to Jude. Words that may appear as a grunt to an untrained ear were\\nuttered, indicating she needed repositioning, as her leg was in pain. Once Jude\\nwas comfortable and smiling again, I turned off her lamp, wished her sweet\\ndreams again, and headed back down to the comfort of a beautiful bed.\\n\\nJude and I had been brought together through word of mouth. Someone in the\\nsongwriting circuit knew I worked as a carer and lived as a house-sitter, so\\npassed my phone number on. The majority of my palliative clients so far had\\nbeen elderly or past middle age, and most were dying of cancer related illnesses,\\nbut not all. Jude’s illness though was a motor neurone disease and she was only\\nforty-four. Her husband and daughter, a delightful nine-year old with curly\\nauburn hair and a precious smile, were loving and beautiful people, as was Jude.\\n\\nBy the time I came to be her carer, they were fed up entirely with agencies\\nwho sent different people all the time. Jude’s needs were many and quite\\nspecific, particularly in understanding her comfort and her deteriorating speech.\\nSo the desire for one main carer became the priority. Other carers were\\nemployed to cover my time off and thankfully I now had enough experience to\\ntrain them. No longer able to support her own weight, we used a hydraulic hoist\\nto move Jude to her wheelchair and bed. Each day I saw her abilities lessen and\\nwas glad to have arrived while she could still communicate reasonably well, as it\\nenabled me to translate the grunts that were to come later.\\n\\nJude came from a very wealthy family and had extreme pressure on her as a\\nyoung adult to marry well and live the life expected of her. Her first car was a\\nluxury model, costing more than most people’s annual salary. She had not\\nstepped foot inside a regular department store until she was in her mid twenties.\\nDesigner clothes were all she knew. Her upbringing had guaranteed this.\\n\\nYet she had always been a creative and very down-to-earth person. The simple\\nlife was all she wanted, she told me. But her parents insisted she go to university,\\ngiving her the choice of studying economics or law. There was no other choice,\\ndespite her brief mention of wanting to study art. So under pressure and\\n\\x0cexpectation, Jude chose law. Her choice was based on the idea that one day her\\nparents would die and she may be able to then put her knowledge into a better\\ncause, either the arts or community welfare. Things didn’t work out that way\\nthough. Her father had passed on by now and it was most likely she would die\\nbefore her mother. Regardless, she was no longer capable of working anyway.\\n\\nHer love of the arts saw her falling in love with Edward, an artist himself.\\nThey both told of an instant attraction that had obviously not dwindled at all in\\nthe years since. Although both had been a little shy at first, the strength of their\\nmutual attraction gave each of them the confidence to be brave.\\n\\nIn no time, they were in love and the whole world fell away as they became\\neach other’s world. Jude’s family was horrified by her choice, as Edward was\\nraised in a lower-class family and was happy with a simple life, pursuing his art.\\nHe was actually quite a successful artist. But he was not a white-collar worker\\nand this was never going to be good enough for Jude’s parents.\\n\\nSadly she was made to choose between her parents and Edward, so she chose\\nEdward. Of course, she laughed. It was never a decision. She loved Edward with\\nall of her heart, as he did her. Jude was then completely ostracised from her\\nfamily. A few close friends remained from earlier years. But she was moving in a\\ndifferent, happier, and more accepting world now, so enjoyed the new\\nfriendships that entered her life too.\\n\\nA few years later, Jude and Edward welcomed their little girl, Layla into the\\nworld. Every effort was made again to reconcile with her parents, as she wanted\\nthem to know their granddaughter. Jude’s father finally conceded and came to\\nenjoy a relationship of love and quality with his dear granddaughter before he\\npassed. His relationship with Jude also improved. While he was polite to\\nEdward, Jude’s father still struggled with the knowledge that an artist had won\\nhis daughter’s heart. So it was not a close relationship. However, it was as a\\nresult of his relationship with Layla, Jude’s father purchased this harbour-side\\nmansion for them all, much to her mother’s disgust.\\n\\nThings had been moving along well, they told me, until Jude had started to\\nbecome clumsy, to the point it could not be ignored anymore. These stories were\\ntold in unison from Jude and Edward and I suspected this would have been the\\ncase, even if she were not struggling with the illness. They were just so close as\\na couple. Their love was both inspiring and heartbreaking for me to witness.\\nThese were people of my own generation.\\n\\nHours of deep and honest conversation unfolded between us all. The\\nacceptance of death at such an age was one we spoke of too. It is easy for us all\\n\\x0cto assume we will live forever. But life doesn’t work that way. Through the\\nstorms of life, some young ones will always go. Like flowers blossoming, not\\nyet ripened into fruit, they will be taken away before they can ever realise their\\nfull potential. Others will make it through to full maturity and go out at their\\nbest. Still others will live past their prime and slowly degenerate over the years.\\n\\nWhile it is often referred to as dying before their time, it isn’t really. We all go\\nwhen it is our own time. Millions of people are not destined to live a long life. It\\nis the assumption we will all live forever, or at least until a very advanced age,\\nthat brings so much shock and despair when someone young passes. But this is\\nactually a natural part of life in all species. Some young ones die, some middle\\naged ones die, and others don’t die until old age. Of course, it is heartbreaking to\\nsee young ones go when it appears they had their whole lives ahead of them.\\nSome of my own friends have lost young children and I have been there through\\ntheir heartache, some of which has never left. But these children or young adults\\nwere not here for such a long life. They come in, shine bright, and are\\nremembered with purity for all they gave during their brief time.\\n\\nEven though Jude had made it all the way through to her forties with good\\nhealth, it also would have been easy to think how wrong it was that such a good\\nwoman was now dying at only forty-four. But she and Edward had come to\\naccept this, both just grateful they had met and known the love they did. They\\nhad also been blessed by bringing Layla into the world. In that regard Jude was\\npeaceful in a way, knowing she’d had the honour of guiding this delightful little\\ngirl through her first nine years. Naturally though, there was also heartache as\\nshe would not be around to watch her little girl become a woman, and for the\\npain Layla may suffer in losing her mum. But it helped Jude a lot knowing that\\nher daughter had a loving dad to help her further on her way.\\n\\nBy now Jude had lost her independence and mobility completely, but her\\ngreatest frustration was that she was losing her speech. The thing she feared\\nmost, she told me one night as I repositioned her in bed, was when she would no\\nlonger be able to convey she was in pain and would have to lie there tolerating it.\\nI thought about how difficult life can be and how different all of our lessons are.\\nWhat an awful way to see your last weeks or months through, to have\\nconsciousness but no ability to communicate. On top of that, to be lying in pain\\nbut no one realising or knowing the exact way to ease it. This must happen the\\nworld over for sufferers of other diseases too, like stroke or brain injuries. Gosh,\\nwhat a way to be. It certainly put my own life back into perspective.\\n\\nEach day I heard Jude’s speech deteriorating a little more. Some days it was\\n\\x0cstill reasonably good, quite audible. Other days, it was only because we knew\\neach other and I worked intuitively that I was able to follow what she was\\nsaying. On days like this, Jude sometimes resorted to using a special computer\\nprogram she had. Between the eyes of some glasses she wore, made especially\\nfor such use, there was a laser that would reach letters on the computer screen.\\nJude would pause on the letter long enough for it to type the letter, then move\\nonto the next one. Then after a couple of letters were written, a choice of words\\nwould appear, and so on. It was a slow process for sure, but it at least enabled\\nher to be heard. I silently thanked those who had created such an opportunity for\\nher by developing this program. The time would come soon enough though,\\nwhen Jude would no longer be able to move her head to even do this.\\n\\nSo on the good days, I listened as much as possible while Jude talked. There\\nwas much she wanted to convey. Holding a juice to her lips I waited, as she took\\none slow sip at a time, enabling her to keep talking. One main point in particular\\nshe needed to make and did so over and over. “We need to be brave enough to\\nexpress our feelings,” she said. Very fitting, I thought, considering my own\\njourney so far.\\n\\nEven though she had lost the relationship with her mother by choosing to be\\nwith Edward, she was happy knowing she’d at least been brave enough to make\\nthat choice, one she’d never regretted. She longed to share her feelings with her\\nmother now though, as her mum had never known Jude as a mother herself.\\nAcknowledging such an opportunity may never come, Jude had already written\\nto her mother some time ago. The letter waited in Edward’s office drawer. Jude’s\\nmum knew of the illness. But she was still in a place of stubbornness and un-\\nforgiveness, unable to visit her dying daughter.\\n\\n“We must learn to express our feelings now,” Jude emphasised. “Not when it\\nis too late. None of us ever know when it will be too late. Tell people you love\\nthem. Tell them you appreciate them. If they can’t accept your honesty or react\\nin a different way to how you hoped, it doesn’t matter. What matters is you have\\ntold them.”\\n\\nJude said this was just as important for those who were passing as for those\\nwho would remain behind. Those passing need to know everything has been\\nsaid. It brings peace, she said. If those who are left behind can muster the\\ncourage to express their feelings honestly too, then they will not carry this regret\\nto their own passing. Nor will they have to live with the guilt that is carried if\\nsomeone they loved has passed and things have gone unsaid.\\n\\nWhat had made getting this point across even more important for Jude was\\n\\x0cthat she had lost a friend unexpectedly a year earlier. It had shaken her world up\\nimmensely. Tracey had been an effervescent woman, the life of any gathering.\\nShe was well loved by everyone due to her enormous heart, and held a total lack\\nof judgment towards others.\\n\\n“Tt is too easy to get caught up in life and not spend as much time with people\\nyou love, whether that be family or friends. But we really must get back to\\nrelationships and honesty. People don’t realise how important this is, until they\\nare dying themselves or living with the guilt after someone else has died,” Jude\\ntold me.\\n\\nShe said how there is no need for guilt at all if we have truly made our best\\nefforts to express our feelings and to spend time with those we love. But we need\\nto stop thinking those we love will be around forever. It is over in a flash, she\\nreminded me. Jude was grateful she’d had time to say her own goodbyes, but\\nemphasised that not everyone receives the blessing of time to express these\\nfeelings at the end. In fact millions don’t, as they depart suddenly and\\nunexpectedly.\\n\\nEven though expressing her feelings about the love she felt for Edward had\\nruined her relationship with her mother, Jude was glad she’d had the courage to\\nbe honest. Not only did it allow her to know the fullness of love she and Edward\\nstill shared, she was peaceful knowing she had been true to her own heart. It also\\nshowed her how much she was under the control of her parents until then,\\nparticularly her mother. If a relationship is based on control she said, how can\\nthe other person ever know a truly healthy relationship with that person anyway?\\nIf this was the only kind of relationship on offer, she decided she was better off\\nwithout it.\\n\\nBut having tried to communicate with her mother, Jude said she would be\\ndying free of guilt. She’d had the courage to express herself. Thankfully, the\\nsame had been the case for her with her friend Tracey. Jude had always been\\nvery honest and though the shock of losing Tracey had been enormous, she was\\nagain guilt-free. Only a few days before losing her friend, they’d had lunch\\ntogether. When they hugged goodbye, Jude had told Tracey how much she loved\\nher and valued their friendship.\\n\\nIt was not the case for most of her friend’s family or other friends though.\\nTracey had been such a bright person that it was hard to ever imagine she would\\nnot be around. Then her life was taken suddenly in a car crash. The ripples of\\nshock and guilt still continued just as strongly in Jude’s circle of friends, a year\\nlater.\\n\\x0c“She had changed people’s lives and they had never told her so. Tracey wasn’t\\nthe sort to need the confirmation, no. But people have to live with their own lack\\nof effort afterwards and I have seen this guilt turn toxic in people since, as they\\nbattle with how differently they could have done things.” I could understand this\\nof course. “Also,” Jude said, “Although Tracey didn’t need the validation, she\\nwould have loved to have heard that encouragement from others. She was so\\nopen and beautiful. And now she is gone.”\\n\\nI naturally agreed with her that sharing feelings and honesty was important.\\nLife was certainly throwing those lessons at me already, even more so now as\\nJude and I talked. She was a beautiful woman, still naturally elegant, despite not\\nbeing able to hold herself well anymore. Her mouth drooled at times and her\\nclothing had to be more practical than stylish. But her spirit and remnants of who\\nshe once was, still remained with its own radiance. Smiling at her and in\\nagreement with her opinion, I shared my thoughts. “Yes. So much is held back\\nby pride, apathy, or fear of reprisal or humiliation. But it also takes a lot of\\ncourage sometimes Jude and we are not always strong enough to do this.”\\n\\n“Yes, it takes courage Bronnie,” Jude continued. “That’s the point I am trying\\nto make. It takes courage to express your feelings, particularly if you are not\\ndoing OK and need assistance, or if you’ve never expressed honest feelings to\\nsomeone you love and don’t know how it will be received. But the more you\\npractice sharing your feelings, whatever they are, the better things become. Pride\\nis such a waste of time. Honestly, look at me now. I can’t even wipe my own\\nbum. What does it matter? We are all human. We are allowed to be vulnerable\\ntoo. It is a part of the process.”\\n\\nLeading up to the time at Jude and Edward’s, life had been particularly hard\\nfor me. I decided to share some of this with Jude, as it was relevant to how hard\\nit can be at times to share our feelings.\\n\\nThe palliative work had slowed down for a while. It often came in those waves\\nof all or nothing. This didn’t bother me, as my creative work benefitted then\\ninstead. After almost two months of hardly any work though, things were\\nstarting to get a bit difficult and there was no work on the horizon. Any money I\\nearned was usually invested back into my creative work in some way, so there\\nwas not a lot to fall back on. But having survived it before, I was never too\\nperturbed about this.\\n\\nHouse-sits likewise came and went. Sometimes I would have very little notice\\nof where I was going next, only knowing when the owners were due to return.\\nUsually though, a house would present itself at the last minute. During stronger\\n\\x0ctimes, I did enjoy this risk and excitement to a degree. The adrenalin certainly\\nflowed. It would happen relatively often, where someone would call me in a\\npanic and ask if I could look after their home, starting tomorrow for example, as\\nthey had just been called away suddenly. The relief that came from those calls\\nalways brought huge sighs and smiles. Such occasions would save us both.\\n\\nSometimes clients worked in with other friends in the house-sit network to\\nensure they wouldn’t miss out on me being available. So they would plan to go\\non holidays the same day their friends were coming back, knowing I would then\\nbe free. On these occasions, I was sometimes booked for months in advance.\\nNaturally, I liked this. It made life much easier.\\n\\nThere were times though, when I was unable to find anywhere to look after for\\na few days, or a week or two, in between scheduled house-sits. So I would either\\nleave town and visit someone in the country, enjoying the break. Or if I had a\\nspecific client who I didn’t want to leave, I would crash out in a friend’s spare\\nroom or on their couch temporarily. Initially this was easy enough. But after a\\nfew years of this pattern, I began to dread asking and felt like I was wearing out\\nmy welcome. My friends said I wasn’t. They supported me and understood me\\nwell enough to know it wasn’t forever. When I had settled home bases years\\nearlier, my homes always had visitors, but for me, learning to receive was so\\nmuch harder than giving.\\n\\nHaving to ask friends repeatedly if I could stay left me feeling absolutely\\nhopeless. While I had worked through a lot of my past wounds, enabling me to\\nhave compassion for others, it was still taking me a lot of work and pain to\\ntransform my thoughts towards myself. Decades of negative patterns were being\\nundone and it was a slow process, to change my thinking completely. New and\\npositive seeds had been planted and in many ways, were sprouting in my life.\\nBut I was yet to eradicate all of the old seeds, so they would still sometimes\\nsurface.\\n\\nOn this particular occasion the work had stopped ages ago, the money had\\npretty much run out and I was feeling hopeless all over again. I rang my closest\\nfriend and asked if I could stay. But she was going through something herself\\nand it was just not possible. This wasn’t about me at all. It was her stuff and her\\nlife. But because of my thinking and emotional state at the time, I took it as a\\ntotal rejection and felt even worse for having put her in the position of having to\\nsay no. I reluctantly called a few other friends but sorry, full house with\\ninterstate visitors, another away, and another consumed in a work project that\\nneeded total concentration. I didn’t have the money to leave town and get back\\n\\x0cwithout having to borrow some, which would have just left me feeling more\\nhopeless anyway. So I accepted I would be sleeping in my car.\\n\\nThis wasn’t an issue years earlier when I had the jeep and was on the road\\ntravelling. In fact, there was nowhere I would have preferred sleeping than in the\\nback of that old car, on the comfy bed in there. But not in the rice bubble, a car\\nso small I couldn’t even straighten out my legs when I tried to lie down. It was\\nalso without curtains or privacy and was the middle of winter. I couldn’t think of\\nanyone I could call though without feeling even worse by asking. As much as I\\nwas a little scared to be sleeping on the city streets so exposed, I was sort of\\nresigned to it, that this is what a hopeless person has to do sometimes.\\n\\nDriving around before dark, I checked out a few options of places that looked\\nrelatively safe and suitable. I also needed to consider I might need to go to the\\ntoilet. Freaking people out by piddling on their front lawn in the middle of the\\nnight was not the kind of attention I needed, on top of my existing emotions.\\n\\nThe days are long when you are homeless and trying to stay out of visibility.\\nYou have to be up and out of the way at sunrise and cannot settle in until\\neveryone else has gone home and settled in themselves. In the meantime of\\ncourse, you are homeless so you can’t go home and wait. Yes, these were long\\ndays and the nights were very uncomfortable, achingly cold, and lonely.\\n\\nOne night I went to a café where I heard some music, staying as late as\\npossible on my one cup of tea. I felt like the old man in the Ralph McTell song,\\n‘Streets of London’, trying to keep his one cup of tea going all night to enable\\nhim to stay indoors. How ironic, I thought, that this had been one of the very\\nfirst songs I ever learned on the guitar.\\n\\nTurning up at the council toilets near the beach at sunrise, I would wait for\\nthem to open. Then I would have a wash, clean my teeth, and use the toilet, all\\nthe while enduring the scowls of the council worker who had unlocked the door.\\nI think he saw me as a camper, freeloading, or something. But there was nothing\\nhe could have thought of me that was any worse than what I was already\\nthinking of myself. So I really didn’t care. And one of the blessings already in\\nplace from my time with the dying was that by now, I genuinely didn’t care what\\nothers thought of me anymore. As it was, I had enough to deal with just with\\nown head.\\n\\nAnother night I went to the Hare Krishna’s ‘Feed the Hungry’ program.\\nWhenever I had money, I was always generous with it. Queuing up now, I found\\nmore irony in my situation as I had often thrown ten or twenty dollars into their\\nbucket for this very program, if I ever saw them trying to raise funds. I liked the\\n\\x0cHare Krishnas. They were vegetarians, played happy music, and fed hungry\\npeople. That was enough for me. But now I was a recipient of their goodwill and\\nit was rather humbling.\\n\\nThen one morning, I sat on a rock by the harbour, praying for strength,\\nendurance, and a miracle. Just then a pod of dolphins came by and one flipped\\nitself out of the water in play. My life felt so serious until that moment, so it gave\\nme a little bit of hope again. I then thought of some friends who lived further out\\nand decided to call them and ask if I could stay. They were always lovely people.\\nBut my sense of unworthiness and hopelessness had not enabled me to ask any\\nmore people for help, or even think of anyone else I could ask. I had not had the\\ncourage to express my feelings even though I could have very honestly just said\\nto these sweet people, “Look, I’m feeling crap. But may I please come and stay\\nfor a little while?”\\n\\nSo with a brighter resolve, I went for a walk around the harbour. Before I had\\nthe opportunity to call my friends though, my phone rang and it was Edward,\\nasking if I was free to come and be Jude’s carer and could I please begin\\nimmediately? There was also a beautiful apartment on the property available for\\nme if I needed. That night I lay with legs fully outstretched again, no longer\\naching with cramps and cold. A snug duvet kept me warm after my nurturing\\nbath. I’d eaten a healthy meal with three delightful people and I was earning\\nmoney again. How quickly life can change!\\n\\nI could look at this time and say it was because the work dried up, or the\\nhouse-sits did. That’s what happened physically anyway. But it was a situation I\\nhad created through my own lack of self-worth and by nurturing old seeds that\\nno longer served me. Obviously there were new seeds being sewn too, as at other\\ntimes I was starting to live an abundant, amazing lifestyle. Learning to undo\\nthese old patterns in my head was taking time though and I had made it harder\\non myself by not being able to ask for help.\\n\\nWhen another lull in house-sitting appeared at a later date, the first thing I did\\nwas to phone the friends I had thought of that morning with the dolphins. They\\nwelcomed me into their spare room with loving joy and excitement. Allowing\\ngoodness in was possible for me again. I was still learning how to express my\\nfeelings, but I was getting there.\\n\\nI told Jude how openness was a learning curve for me, as I had become so shut\\ndown in the past. So I appreciated her opinion and the opportunity to discuss this\\nall so honestly. “We all need the reminder Bronnie. Everyone holds things in that\\nneed to be said, whether it is what people want to hear or not. We must express\\n\\x0cour feelings in order to grow. It helps everyone in one way or another, even if\\nthey don’t realise it. Above all else, honesty works.”\\n\\nSmiling, I looked out at the boats on the harbour as the full moon shone\\nbeautifully on the water. It was a magnificent setting. Jude returned to the\\nsubject of guilt and how we have a choice to not create it by honestly expressing\\nour feelings as they surface. Then it is never too late, especially if someone we\\nlove passes unexpectedly. It also enables us to be free of constraints, as we once\\nwere as children. We should never feel guilty for expressing our feelings and we\\nshould never make someone else feel guilty if they have found the courage to do\\nSO.\\n\\nAfter a couple of months with Jude, her deterioration became so severe she\\nwas admitted into a palliative care hospice. Work was flowing for me again back\\nat the agency and a decent length house-sit had presented itself. I dropped into\\nthe hospice to see Jude, pleased to be able to catch up with Edward and Layla at\\nthe same time. Sitting on the other side of the bed was a lady I’d never met, but\\nit took no time to see the likeness between Jude and her mother.\\n\\nEdward had taken it on his own initiative to deliver Jude’s letter to her mother,\\nbefore his beloved Jude passed over. By now she was unable to talk, but it had\\nall been said in the letter. Jude had told her mother she had loved her, and still\\ndid. She wrote of happy memories she held dear and of the positive things she\\nhad learned from her mum. The letter contained nothing negative, as Jude hated\\nguilt and wanted her mother to know she was loved, despite the sadness of their\\nrelationship. Jude’s mother had turned up unexpectedly a few days later and had\\nbeen back every day since, holding Jude’s hand, watching as her daughter’s life\\nwas coming to an end.\\n\\nKissing Jude on the cheek after talking to her for a while, I said my final\\ngoodbye and thanked her for everything. “See you when I get there, Jude,” I said\\nthrough tears and a smile. She grunted back and her eyes smiled, even though\\nher mouth no longer could.\\n\\nEdward and Layla walked me out to the rice bubble, both of them holding one\\nof my hands each. We were all tearful. But love flowed so honestly that tears\\ndidn’t matter. He told me that Jude’s mum had been talking a lot to her and tears\\nhad fallen down Jude’s cheeks, particularly when she heard her mother say she\\nloved her. Her mother apologised for having been so judgmental. She admitted\\nto being secretly jealous of her daughter, and of Jude’s courage to step out of the\\nopinions of society, something that had robbed herself of true happiness.\\n\\nAfter hugging both Edward and Layla goodbye, I wished them all the very\\n\\x0cbest in life ahead. I thought of beautiful Jude lying there with her mother sitting\\nat her side, and how powerful the force of love really is. My heart was aching\\nbut it was also joyful.\\n\\nAn email came a couple of years later from Edward, which was a lovely\\nsurprise. Layla and her grandmother had enjoyed some cheerful months of\\ngetting to know each other before the older lady had died. He said she was a\\ndifferent woman by then and reminded him of his beautiful Jude at times. When\\nthe estates were settled, Edward and Layla decided to leave the city and move up\\nto the mountains, closer to his father and where the air was cleaner. He had met a\\nnew lady about a year ago and Layla now had a little sister on the way.\\n\\nMy reply included my best of wishes to them all. I was also happy to share\\nwith him the things I remembered about Jude: her smile, her patience with the\\nillness, her acceptance, and her determination to get her points across. Guilt is\\ntoxic. Expressing our feelings is a necessity for a happy life.\\n\\nI can still remember sitting beside her bed as the full moon shone on the water,\\nwith Jude determined to be heard for as long as her voice would allow.\\n\\nShe’d made her point and I now know the joy of expressing my feelings, as\\nhonestly as that dolphin showed its joy when it flipped up out of the water.\\n\\x0cGIFTS IN DISGUISE\\neter\\n\\nA few temporary shifts in nursing homes had seen me working with clients\\nsuffering from Alzheimer’s. But Nanci was my first private home, palliative\\nclient with this disease. She had been a gentle woman, the mother of three\\nchildren and ten grandchildren. Her husband was still about, but rarely came into\\nher room. In fact, it would have been easy to forget he actually lived in the house\\nat all.\\n\\nNanci’s three sisters and two brothers would come and visit on alternate days,\\nas would a few of her friends initially, though I did observe these visitations slow\\ndown in time. Looking after Nanci was hard, exhausting work. She was restless\\nand very hard to monitor, never wanting to stay in one place for more than one\\nminute, and very distressed much of the time. Moments of peace were few and\\nfar between for her, and as a result, for me too.\\n\\nEventually her anguish became so concerning to everyone, especially her\\nfamily, that the dosage of her medications was increased. Nanci then slept some\\nof the day. When she was alert, her words and sentences made no sense at all, as\\nis typical of those with Alzheimer’s. Parts of one word were mingled with parts\\nof others. You could recognise it as an English dialect at times, but nothing\\nstructured, formal, or coherent. Still, I treated Nanci as I did all of my clients,\\nwith love and gentleness, chatting to her as I did my job. Sometimes she\\nacknowledged I was in the room, sometimes she was miles away and I could\\nhave had ten heads without her noticing.\\n\\nOccasionally I would shower her myself, when I arrived at eight in the\\nmorning, but this was usually the night carer’s role. Washing her fell to me if it\\nhad been a particularly troublesome night and Nanci was still sleeping when I\\narrived, which was fine. More often than not though, the showering would be\\nhappening when I arrived around eight. Nanci would sometimes smile at me as\\nshe sat on the shower chair, while the night carer washed her. One particular\\ncarer though had significantly different methods of care than the rest of us and\\nshe insisted that was the way things were done where she came from.\\n\\nThe first incident happened one very cold winter morning. Arriving in Nanci’s\\nroom, I found her lying naked on her bed, shivering cold, and fully exposed. She\\n\\x0chad just been showered and while there, her bowels had opened, leaving a huge\\npile of faeces under the shower chair. This was nothing new. Clients often\\nexperienced this when their backsides were hanging through the opening of the\\nchair, as their bowels recognised it as a toilet seat. These chairs were also used to\\nsit over a toilet, if clients needed an elevated seat. So it was not entirely\\nsurprising that sometimes these things happened in the shower.\\n\\nNanci was a modest woman, from a modest family. So lying there naked\\nwithout any covering would have been traumatic enough for her, but she was\\nalso shivering cold and looked like a fragile little child. The minute I walked in\\nand saw her like that, I finished drying her off and covered her with a warm\\nblanket as soon as possible. The other carer was found in the bathroom, cleaning\\nup the mess. It was impossible for me not to comment, although I did so\\ndiplomatically, saying I could have cleaned it up later. The priority needed to be\\nthe client’s comfort rather than a clean bathroom floor. The night carer’s only\\nresponse was a shrug.\\n\\nThe other incident came while crossing over shifts with the same carer a few\\nweeks later. Generally I don’t like to wear a watch and avoid having to be\\nstructured by a clock at all if I can help it. But rather than causing stress by\\nhaving to rush, if I must work in to a strictly regulated timetable, I usually tend\\nto leave myself excess time to get to places. This allows me to enjoy the journey\\nmore, however long or brief, and to be more present along the way. On this\\nparticular morning though, the traffic had been flowing particularly well. So I\\narrived earlier than expected.\\n\\nFollowing the other incident, the night carer had now taken to showering\\nNanci even earlier. So I saw none of her procedures. The carer and I actually got\\nalong quite well. We always had, as we had shared a few clients and had often\\nseen each other at handover of shifts during the past years. The lack of empathy I\\nhad witnessed from her with Nanci and previous clients though, did leave me\\nstruggling to continue regarding her as a caring professional. This increased even\\nmore when I walked into the bathroom to say good moming, and found dear\\nlittle Nanci sitting on the shower chair, shivering cold, absolutely freezing, with\\nher teeth chattering.\\n\\nAsking what was happening, the carer explained that where she was from this\\nis how they showered people. Freezing cold water blasted all over the body for a\\ncouple of minutes, followed by a couple of minutes of lovely warm water,\\nfollowed by another couple of minutes of cold, then warm, but always finishing\\noff with cold. It gets the circulation going she said, which could be right. I\\n\\x0cwouldn’t know and I didn’t care, though I did accept that swimming in cold\\nwater had often left me feeling very invigorated.\\n\\nThe problem was that it was the middle of winter. Winds howled outside,\\nwindows shook, and even indoors, decent layers of clothing were required. This\\nlittle lady was so ill she was dying. She hardly needed invigoration to go running\\naround the block. Nanci was too frail to do anything by now and just needed to\\nbe warm and comfortable. Our job was to attend to her wellbeing, which\\nincluded this comfort, not having her sit on a shower chair looking completely\\nterrified, so cold her teeth were chattering. In my opinion, the poor darling just\\nneeded to be snug and lovingly cared for.\\n\\nNever having been terribly forceful, I can draw on my strength when required\\nthough. What triggers this forcefulness is injustice or cruelty. Speaking gently\\nbut honestly to the other carer, my message was received and she accepted that\\njust warm water would be used for the rest of the shower.\\n\\nThe days continued to unfold in a series of routines. This particular night carer\\nwas heading off on holidays and would not be back for a long while. Her\\nreplacement was another carer I had often met in passing, Linda. It was always\\nrefreshing to come onto a shift after her, as she was pleasant to chat with and her\\nwork ethic was of a high quality. Relieved for our client, I sent out a prayer of\\nthanks.\\n\\nNanci continued to speak as incoherently as always. When she was out of bed,\\nshe was still restless and agitated most of the time. But due to the increase in her\\nmedication, these occasions were not for so long. The sides on her bed were\\nsupposed to be up the whole time. But if things were calm, I would lower the\\nrailings to remove the barrier between us. Sometimes Nanci would respond well\\nto some pampering, like when I rubbed cream into her legs or things like that.\\nBut even during the calmer moments, if Nanci did speak it was always in the\\nlanguage only Alzheimer’s sufferers would understand. There was no clarity or\\nstructure, just mumbled syllables that didn’t work together. Her speech had\\nalready been like this for several months by the time I met her.\\n\\nAfter assisting her to the toilet one day, she shuffled back towards the bed\\nholding one of my hands. A tube of something in my other hand slipped to the\\nfloor and I laughed, bending down to pick it up. I always treated Nanci the way I\\nwould any client, even if she was miles away. So I stood up again, still talking to\\nher and laughing. Then as clear as day, looking me straight in the eye, Nanci\\nsaid, “I think you’re lovely”.\\n\\nA huge smile broke onto my face and we stood smiling at each other for a\\n\\x0cminute. I was looking at a totally sane and present woman. At that moment, she\\nknew completely what was going on. So I replied truthfully, “I think you are too\\nNanci”. Her smile grew wider and we hugged, after which we both smiled at\\neach other again. It was beautiful.\\n\\nHer balance wasn’t great by now though, so we continued to shuffle back to\\nthe bed holding hands. As I sat her on the side and bent to lift her legs up, Nanci\\ncame out with a jumbled sentence of Alzheimer’s language, one that had no\\nchance of being understood by anyone. She was gone again, but she had been\\nthere with me briefly, as clear as anything.\\n\\nNo one will ever convince me otherwise. Alzheimer’s sufferers may not know\\nwhat is going on most of the time, but just because they cannot convey their\\nthoughts clearly and are often very confused, this does not mean they do not\\nabsorb some of what is going on. Seeing this first hand changed my whole\\nperspective of the illness and others.\\n\\nA few weeks later I mentioned the incident to Linda, the other carer, who\\nagreed it was a special thing to have happened. A short time later, Linda then\\nexperienced further clarity from Nanci, though perhaps not so endearing. It was\\na part of her night shift duties to roll Nanci over every four hours, to avoid\\nbedsores. Often Nanci would be in a deep sleep but it had to be done, doctor’s\\norders. On this particular night though, as Linda went to roll her over at about\\nfour in the morning, Nanci very firmly and clearly said to her, “Don’t you dare\\nmove me”.\\n\\n“No worries Nanci,” Linda replied startled. “Sweet dreams.” Linda was\\namazed but went back to sleeping.\\n\\nThe family came and relieved me for half an hour each day. They were long\\nand exhausting shifts, and I welcomed the break. Nanci’s home was in a beach\\nsuburb, so I would head straight down the hill and stand on a rock shelf looking\\nout to sea. The rocks were partially covered with barnacles and puddles of ocean\\nwater, but there were plenty of places to step, allowing me to access the edge of\\nthe shelf safely. Breathing in the ocean air, I’d delight in the fresh breeze and the\\nvastness of the ocean. Occasionally there would be another person further along\\nthe rocks, further out, right on the point. He would be playing a saxophone. It\\nwas magical to observe and to hear, such perfect tunes floating across with the\\nrhythm of the ocean. I would stand there spellbound, absorbing it for every\\npossible moment before reluctantly heading back up the hill. The music would\\nsustain me for the rest of the shift, every time without fail.\\n\\nNaturally I would tell Nanci about it, even if she were completely off in\\n\\x0canother world. It didn’t bother me. My intention was to try and keep her world a\\nlittle stimulated if I could, by bringing in conversation from the outside world.\\nNanci’s whole world by now was just her bedroom, en-suite and sitting room.\\n\\nFor a couple of months the saxophone man was mentioned to her, with no\\nresponse or sign of interest reflected back. Then one day when I returned elated\\nand tried to describe the tune he had played that day (like you can ever truly\\ndescribe music through words), Nanci looked me in the eyes and smiled. As I\\nput some washing away a few minutes later, she started humming a tune. This\\nwas usually the time of day she was most agitated, but instead she hummed for\\nages. As quickly as it had started though, it stopped and she was miles away\\nagain, uttering incomprehensible syllables.\\n\\nThese glimpses of clarity made me so grateful to have kept talking to Nanci all\\nthis time, regardless that I was usually not getting the responses I may have\\nliked. But just because someone doesn’t respond the way you wish, doesn’t\\nmean you should regret the attempt to having expressed yourself.\\n\\nThe reaction of others is their choice, just as our own reactions are no one\\nelse’s responsibility. As my walls were being eroded one brick at a time, I was\\nfinding the need to express myself increasing. To express who I am now became\\nmore important. Yet, in other ways, it also became less important as I was also\\nbecoming less bothered by how I was perceived. In the end, I guess it was\\nmostly about how I perceived myself. I wanted to be courageous and honest\\nfrom here on, regardless. Learning to be open was also starting to feel good, very\\ngood in fact.\\n\\nYet I also knew that just because I was changing in many positive ways, it\\ndidn’t mean others in my life would embrace this. New patterns were being\\ncreated, releasing me slowly from my past, beginning to empower me. This was\\nnot always well received by others, but I had to be who I was now and not who\\npeople had come to expect me to be. There was a new person being born from\\nwithin me and she wanted to come out, to share her new self.\\n\\nOne particular friendship in my life was feeling terribly unbalanced and had\\nbeen for a few years. Obviously it was a lesson in boundaries for me, and one I\\nwas learning. Then with all of the changes happening within, including the\\nsatisfaction of honest expression, it came to the point where I finally needed to\\nsay how I was feeling. So with honesty, I explained my thoughts in the hope they\\nwould be understood. It wasn’t an attack on the friend, merely just me sharing\\nwhat I was feeling about the expectation on me to make all of the effort for our\\nvisits and the imbalance I felt was happening.\\n\\x0cWe had been friends for a long time and I felt honesty would get us through.\\nWhat it did though was to show me how it was only history and habit that had\\nbeen holding us together recently. My friend lashed out at me with anger I had\\nno idea she owned. It was fear and hurt that triggered this in her. I understood\\nthat, but the level of anger that came at me was overwhelming. I realised I didn’t\\nactually know this person at all. There was nastiness in her I had never even\\nglimpsed or suspected. So when she then severed our connection completely, I\\naccepted her decision and peacefully obliged. It was time to move on.\\n\\nEither way, I still reflected on our friendship as a beautiful gift for the years it\\nhad existed, and still do. In the end, only happy memories remain, but letting go\\nof the friendship was relatively painless, as I could see no point in having a\\nrelationship that did not allow for honesty or balance. None of us are perfect,\\nmyself included. I contributed to the breakdown of that friendship too, whether\\nconsciously or not, but to be in any sort of relationship where you do not express\\nyourself, simply to keep the peace, is a relationship ruled by one person and will\\nnever be balanced or healthy.\\n\\nAt the other end of the scale, honesty enhanced a different friendship a couple\\nof years later. Life was changing a lot for me. So I would sometimes call, to\\nbounce it off someone who knew me well, but this friend was rarely available,\\nuntil she needed me again. This all came to a head one day and through my\\nweariness, I expressed very honestly how I really needed to lean on her for a\\nwhile. That truthfulness brought us closer ten-fold and opened up a beautiful\\nconversation. She shared a lot with me too, and our friendship benefitted from\\nmutual respect and emotional maturity. In the end, she was not the kind of\\nperson who could be totally reliable and we both came to acknowledge and\\naccept this.\\n\\nInstead, I came to lean on myself more and rely upon longer-term friends.\\nWhile this released my need of the friendship a little, my friend also had to\\nadjust to me not always being available for her. I wasn’t always strong enough to\\nbe, nor did I feel the need to play that role anymore. The acceptance of each\\nother’s frailties and the courage to be honest with each other brought us even\\ncloser on many other levels. These days, the friendship is without pressure from\\neither side. It is mature, very honest and always fun.\\n\\nWe don’t catch up as often as we used to and our lives are not so entwined as\\nthey once were. All relationships go through changes though, friendships\\nincluded. Despite all that unfolded, we are closer friends than ever now. We are\\nhonest and totally accepting of each other for who we really are, not who we\\n\\x0cwanted each other to be. When we do manage to catch up, we both savour the\\ngift of time and understanding we are blessed with.\\n\\nSo while expressing feelings may come at a price, as it did with the first\\nfriendship, I know any remaining relationships in my life are now of mature\\nhonesty and true quality. Expressing who I am is one of my core driving forces\\nthese days. Being honest and opening up also gets easier all the time. It took a\\nlong time to get to this place, but it is immensely freeing. It also enables me to\\nrecognise the struggle others go through in trying to do so. When I look at the\\nrewards that come from honest expression, I can only hope others will find that\\nplace in themselves one day too.\\n\\nNanci’s brief response to me, amidst the jumbled language she lived with, was\\none of the most beautiful moments ever. Had I not expressed myself to her prior,\\nregardless of expecting a reaction or not, I would never have received such a\\nreward as that moment.\\n\\nAssuming others know how you feel or will always be there, are high risks to\\ntake when they could be dead in an hour. So could any of us. Taking people for\\ngranted is a high price to pay. Not every day is going to be a happy one. We are\\nall growing and all have hard days, but there are beautiful thoughts to be shared\\ntoo. This is why it is imperative to share your feelings honestly and listen to\\nothers on a regular basis. It is too easy to get caught up in your own little world\\nand forget.\\n\\nThere is a song by a well-known and loved Australian songwriter and\\nperformer, Mick Thomas, that perfectly conveys taking people for granted. It is\\nabout getting caught up in life, so much that the guy in the song wouldn’t even\\nnotice if his woman has changed the colour of her hair or other attributes. The\\nmain message and line in the song is, “He forgot she was beautiful”.\\n\\nWhile the song applies to a guy taking his woman for granted, it can be\\napplied to anyone in our lives. Women take their men for granted too, no longer\\nseeing their inner or outer beauty. Women also don’t always recognise that a man\\nshows his love in different ways, like doing things for his partner. Kids take their\\nparents for granted. Parents take their children for granted sometimes. Friends,\\ncousins, brothers, sisters, workmates, grandparents, and members of the\\ncommunity are all taken for granted.\\n\\nIt is easy to focus on what we don’t like about a person, which is really only a\\npartial reflection of ourselves anyway. But even the things we love about others\\nare too often not acknowledged. Yes, it takes courage sometimes to speak\\nhonestly and we cannot control the reaction of those with whom we share this\\n\\x0copenness with. We must be sensitive to their needs as well.\\n\\nI have found that honesty is rewarded though, even if it may not be in the way\\nwe anticipate. It may come as self-respect, or living without guilt when someone\\nhas passed on, richer relationships, unhealthy relationships being relinquished\\nfrom your life, or in any number of unimagined forms. The main point is that by\\nhaving the courage to express your feelings, you are bringing gifts to yourself\\nand others. The longer you delay this expression, the longer you are carrying\\nthings that need to be said.\\n\\nNo more words of clarity flowed from Nanci again, but it didn’t matter. The\\nblessing I had received that day was more than enough of a reward. Her\\ngrandson also noticed another moment of clarity when he sang to her one\\nafternoon. Nanci didn’t speak, but she looked her grandson in the eye and smiled\\nlovingly at him — not in an Alzheimer’s way, but as a grandmother smiling\\nproudly at her grandson, peaceful with the expression he had chosen that day,\\nthrough singing.\\n\\nWe can never know the gifts that will flow to us until they arrive, but of one\\nthing I am certain. Courage and honesty are always rewarded.\\n\\x0cREGRET 4:\\nI WISH I HAD STAYED IN TOUCH WITH\\nMY FRIENDS\\n\\netexon9\\n\\nOccasional shifts were done in nursing homes, in between regular clients in their\\nprivate houses. They were not common shifts, to which I was grateful as I found\\nthese places absolutely awful. The clients attended to in these situations were not\\nalways palliative either. They were just people in some need of help, and\\nsometimes I was employed simply to be an extra staff member in an existing\\nteam, rather than looking after any one particular client.\\n\\nIf ever one wants to live in denial about the state of our society, avoid nursing\\nhomes. If ever you feel strong enough to look at life honestly, spend some time\\nin one. There are a lot of lonely people in them — a lot. Any of us could become\\na patient at any time.\\n\\nBeing exposed to the staff on these occasions was both devastating and\\ninspiring. Some of those I worked with briefly over the years were beautiful,\\ngoodhearted people who were obviously working in the right field. Their spirits\\nwere bright, their hearts kind. Thank goodness for these people. But as most\\nnursing homes were understaffed, they were constantly challenged to spread\\ntheir good cheer around.\\n\\nAt the other end of the scale were those who had either grown weary and\\ndespondent working in the field, or had never had the enthusiasm in the first\\nplace. Empathy goes a long way in life and was lacking terribly in the team I\\nwas placed with on the night I met Doris.\\n\\nThe residents shuffled into the communal dining room on their walking sticks\\nand frames. They were people from relatively decent means, as it was a private\\nand so-called ‘luxurious’ nursing home. The décor was lovely, the gardens well\\nmaintained, the communal areas clean. But the meals were awful. Everything\\nwas pre-cooked outside of the home and reheated in the microwave, without\\ntaste or enticing aroma. There was nothing nutritious or fresh about any food I\\nsaw there. Residents placed their orders at the end of the previous week and\\n\\x0cusually had a plate of something slid in front of them, with no greeting or\\nkindness from the staff.\\n\\nSeeing a cheerful face, they would touch my hand to keep me at the table\\ntalking with them. These were regular people whose minds were clear and who\\nloved social interaction. Their bodies were ageing and becoming frail, but that\\nwas all. A year or two earlier these same charming, delightful people were living\\ncompletely independent lives of their own. As I returned to the kitchen for\\nanother tray of plates, scowls from some of the staff awaited me. I had merely\\nchatted and laughed with some of the residents briefly on my round and this was\\nmet with disapproval. I just ignored it.\\n\\nReturning a plate of lamb, I told the head person in a friendly manner, “Bernie\\nordered chicken, not lamb”.\\n\\nShe half laughed replying, “He’ll get what he’s bloody-well given”.\\n\\n“Come on,” I said, not intimidated by the nonsense. “Surely we can give him a\\nchicken dish.”\\n\\n“He’ll get lamb or he’ll starve,” she said bitterly. I looked at her with\\ncompassion for her obvious unhappiness, but with no respect for her manner in\\nthe role she was playing.\\n\\nA lovely staff member fell into step with me as I returned the lamb to Bernie.\\n“Don’t worry about her Bronnie. She’s always like that,” Rebecca said.\\n\\nI smiled, glad for a genuine heart. “I’m not worried about her at all. It’s the\\nresidents I care about who have to live with this treatment day in and day out.”\\n\\nRebecca agreed, “It used to affect me a lot when I first started here. But now I\\njust do what I can to give them all the kindest treatment possible, within my\\nlimitations”.\\n\\n“Good on you,” I replied with a smile.\\n\\nShe rubbed my back as she walked off in another direction. “There are a few\\nof us who care, not enough, but there are a few.”\\n\\nWhen the meals were served and somehow eaten, and the kitchen was clean,\\nsome of the staff members went outside for a smoke. A few of us stayed inside\\nand chatted to the departing residents. It was jovial, as a dozen or so people\\ngathered around to share a laugh with us. Their wit and cheerful spirits amazed\\nme as I marvelled at the resilience of these people, having adapted so well to\\ntheir new conditions.\\n\\nEach of the residents had their own room and bathroom. As I did the nightly\\nround of helping people to get dressed for bed, each room revealed some\\npersonality of its resident. Photos of smiling families, paintings, crocheted rugs\\n\\x0cand favourite teacups dotted each room. Some balconies had pot plants on them.\\n\\nDoris was already dressed in her pink nightdress when I breezed in cheerfully,\\nintroducing myself. But she just smiled without saying anything then looked\\naway. Asking if she was OK, I was then met with a flood of tears. Immediately\\nsitting beside her on the bed, I held her in my arms. No words were spoken while\\nshe sobbed, holding onto me desperately. I prayed for strength and waited.\\n\\nWhen the tears stopped, it was as quickly as they had started and she reached\\nfor her handkerchief. “Oh silly me,” she said wiping her eyes. “Forgive me,\\nSweetheart. I’m just being a silly old woman.”\\n\\n“What’s going on with you?” I asked gently.\\n\\nDoris sighed then shared how she had been there for four months and had\\nhardly seen a cheerful face since. She said my smile had set her tears off, which\\nalmost made me want to cry. Her one daughter now lived in Japan and while she\\nwas in touch fairly often, they were no longer terribly close.\\n\\n“You never think as a mother nursing your beautiful little girl that anything\\ncould ever take away your closeness. But it has. Life has. Not through an\\nargument, mind. Just life and its busyness,” she shared. “She has her own life\\nnow and I learned over the years you just have to let go. I brought her into the\\nworld, but we do not own our children. We are just blessed with the role of\\nguiding them until they can fly on their own and that’s what she is doing now.”\\n\\nI warmed to this dear lady instantly and promised to return in half an hour for\\na longer chat, if she could stay awake long enough for me to finish my shift. She\\nsaid she would love that.\\n\\nLater then, Doris sat up in bed talking away. In a chair beside her, I listened.\\nShe held my hand the whole time, now and then playing with my fingers or the\\nring I was wearing, without realising she was doing so. “I have been dying of\\nloneliness in here, Sweetheart. I had heard it was possible and it is. Loneliness\\ncan surely kill you. I get so starved for human touch at times,” she said sadly.\\nMy hug had been the first she had had in four months.\\n\\nShe didn’t want to burden me with it but I insisted on her continuing. I was\\ngenuinely interested in knowing her, so she went on. “I am missing my friends\\nmost of all. Some have died. Some are in situations like me. Some I have lost\\ntouch with. I wish I hadn’t lost touch with them. You imagine your friends will\\nalways be there. But life moves on and suddenly you find yourself with no one\\nin the world who understands you or who knows anything about your history.” I\\nsuggested we try to reach some of them. She shook her head saying, “I wouldn’t\\nknow where to start”.\\n\\x0c“T can help,” I offered as I went onto explain about the Internet to her. It was\\nall very foreign to Doris and she did well to understand it to a degree. At first she\\ndeclined, worried about my time. Finally though, I convinced her I would love\\nto. Investigative skills were something I enjoyed. During my years in banking, I\\nhad worked for a short time in frauds and forgeries and had loved it. She laughed\\nat the comparison. “Please allow me,” I requested. So she agreed with a hopeful,\\nwistful smile.\\n\\nI wanted to help Doris for a few reasons. I had liked her from that first\\nmoment and I could help her. I had the skills to try to find her friends but also\\nwanted to help because I knew how she felt. I had also known the crippling pain\\nof long-term loneliness and the longing for understanding.\\n\\nIn previous times, the pain of my past had worn me down to such a place that I\\nhad withdrawn a long way into myself. It was the misled belief many people\\nexperience, that if you keep people out, you keep the pain out. You stop yourself\\nfrom being hurt even more. If no one can get close, then no one can hurt you\\nanymore either. Of course the only real way to heal is to let love flow in and\\nthrough again, not to block it out, but reaching that point can take a long time.\\n\\nOn the surface I was a friendly person to those I came across but the pain I\\nwas carrying from my difficult past was still weighing me down. I had definitely\\ngrown into a place of compassion by now for those who had previously thrown\\ntheir negativity my way. That wasn’t the problem. It was my thoughts of myself\\nthat were still taking some time to be transformed. Decades of negative thinking\\nwere being undone and at times the pain was unbearable. Although I knew\\nintellectually that I was worth more than what I had been conditioned to believe,\\nemotionally the healing still had distance to go.\\n\\n‘Sunday morning coming down’ became my theme song. Having always loved\\nKris Kristofferson’s music and being quite influenced by him in my own writing,\\nI found that song to be the best expression of my loneliness. Sundays were\\nalways the worst. Lucinda Williams wrote a good song about this too, singing “I\\ncan’t seem to make it through Sundays”.\\n\\nIt wasn’t just Sundays though. Loneliness leaves emptiness in the heart that\\ncan physically kill you. The ache is unbearable and the longer it hangs around,\\nthe more despair adds to it. Miles of city streets, country roads, and everything in\\nbetween were walked during those years. Loneliness isn’t a lack of people. It is a\\nlack of understanding and acceptance. Huge amounts of people the world over\\nhave experienced loneliness in crowded rooms. In fact, being alone in crowded\\nrooms often highlights and exacerbates loneliness.\\n\\x0cIt doesn’t matter how many people are around you. If there is no one available\\nwho understands you, or accepts you as who you are, loneliness can very readily\\npresent its agonising self. It is very different than being alone, as I had loved this\\noften in the past. Being alone can mean you are lonely or you are happy.\\nLoneliness is a longing for the company of one who understands you.\\nSometimes being alone and loneliness are related, but very often they are not.\\n\\nThe loneliness became so unbearable, the ache in my heart so constant, suicide\\nbecame an occasional accompanying thought. I didn’t want to die at all of\\ncourse. I wanted to live. But realising my own worth, not what I had been led to\\nbelieve, and breaking free of the pain, sometimes took incredible strength to\\nmaster. Allowing love and happiness to flow back through my life, to even\\naccept I deserved it, was so unbearably difficult at times that the option of\\nsuicide felt more appealing.\\n\\nAs the pain and loneliness finally became too much to bear, when I had\\nreached the most painful place so far, my prayers were answered via an act of\\nkindness and understanding. A friend rang at the perfect time. He knew I was\\ngoing through some hard stuff but he didn’t know at that very moment I was\\nwriting my exit letter through slow, heartbroken tears. I was ready to go. I just\\ncouldn’t live with the constant ache in my heart anymore.\\n\\nHe insisted I didn’t have to say a word. I just had to listen. So via my\\nexhaustion and tears, I reluctantly agreed. Through the phone I heard him begin\\nto play his guitar then the words “Starry, starry night” from Don McLean’s song\\n“Vincent” started to reach my ears as he sang to me, replacing Vincent with\\nBronnie. My tears just fell harder as I related to the song, its tragedy and pain,\\nthe gentle melody telling the story of Vincent’s Van Gogh’s own suffering. When\\nhe had finished, I continued to sob. There was nothing else I could do. He sat\\npatiently in silence, and then I thanked him and hung up the phone still crying. I\\nwasn’t capable of more words at the time.\\n\\nFalling asleep that night I was totally drained and emotionally exhausted. I\\nacknowledged though, that through my friend’s understanding and kind\\nintentions, a small pilot light of hope had at least been reignited. The following\\nevening a friend from England rang out of the blue. We talked long and honestly,\\nand my strength slowly started to return little by little.\\n\\nOn another very difficult occasion though, sometime later but during those\\nsame lonesome years, I was pleading and praying for help, trying so hard to be\\nstrong. At the time I was driving into town and I hit a bird. It had been of a\\ndecent size and the noise on the windscreen was enough to wake me up. Of\\n\\x0ccourse being an animal lover, this made me feel even more abysmal in a way but\\nit was a good wake-up call. Life can be over as quick as that and did I really\\nwant mine to be so?\\n\\nI thanked the bird for the role it had played in my evolution and drove on with\\nmore mindfulness. Just then a piece of classical music came onto the radio,\\nlifting me into the most beautiful place. The incredibly delicate sounds soothed\\nme, gently wiping away my heartache. Instead, I was blessed with a beautiful\\nand inspiring moment as the music soared. I decided then that this is what life\\nwas about: Beautiful moments of purity. That’s it, as simple as that. Beautiful\\nmoments. And I wanted to live, to experience and acknowledge more of them.\\n\\nHaving previously been to this level of sadness and loneliness though, I now\\nunderstood that the pain Doris was experiencing was real and tangible for her.\\nShe was around people at meal times, and here and there during the day. But she\\nwas longing for understanding and acceptance, missing her friends because they\\nwere the people who truly understood her. If I could help to ease that pain, then\\nwhy wouldn’t I?\\n\\nThe following week I dropped in to find a list of names waiting for me in the\\ndear lady’s lovely handwriting. Doris told me what she could about the four\\nfriends and where they had been living when she had last made contact. We\\ndrank tea as she shared their stories with me.\\n\\nOne of the women was easy to locate, but she had suffered a stroke and could\\nno longer talk. With news of this, Doris dictated a brief message that her friend’s\\nson would read on to her. While she was saddened to hear of her friend’s state,\\nshe was peaceful knowing a message could at least be passed on.\\n\\nDear Elsie. I am sorry to hear you are not well. Years have flown by. Alison is\\nstill living in Japan. I sold the house and I am in a nursing home. A young lady\\nis writing this for me. I love you Elsie.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nDoris.\\n\\nIt was simple, but said everything she wanted to. I called Elsie’s son that night\\nand passed the words on. He called me back later telling me how Elsie had\\nsmiled in delight. I passed this onto Doris, which then left her with a smile of\\ncontent.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, I managed to find out about another two of her\\nfriends. Sadly they had both already passed over. Doris nodded in acceptance of\\n\\x0cthis. Sighing she said, “Well, it was probably to be expected, Sweetheart”.\\n\\nThe pressure to find the last friend left me very determined. Scanning the\\nInternet and making numerous phone calls, things were not looking good. People\\nwere lovely and helpful when I called but, “Sorry. Right name. Wrong family,”\\nbecame a familiar reply.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I still visited Doris twice a week. She would always hold one\\nof my hands as soon as I sat down, and for the duration of our conversations.\\nSometimes insisting I must have better things to do, she would try to rush me off\\nor convince me not to come. When I assured her I was gaining great pleasure\\nfrom our time too, which I was, I would see the relief on her face and the\\neagerness for each new visit. There is much to learn from older people, so much\\nhistory is carried forward with them. How could I not enjoy our delightful\\nconversations? They were fascinating.\\n\\nA breakthrough finally came while looking for the last friend. I received a\\nphone call from an elderly man who said he had once been Lorraine’s neighbour.\\nHe told me what suburb the family had moved on to and I was successful in\\ntracking her down. In fact, it was Lorraine herself who answered the phone in\\nher elderly, but friendly voice. Explaining who I was and my intention, she\\ngasped in joy and wholeheartedly agreed for me to give Doris her number.\\n\\nNaturally, I took it straight in to her. Hugging Doris as I grinned, I then handed\\nher the piece of paper with Lorraine’s name and number on it. She grabbed me\\nagain and hugged me full of excitement. It was precious. Signalling for me to\\nbring the phone, I couldn’t get it fast enough for her. Before the number was\\ndialled though, I said I would leave her to her phone call rather than just sit in on\\nthem both. She protested mildly but I could see she really didn’t mind. She was\\ntoo excited. Asking me stay until the call went through though, I agreed. So we\\nexchanged a warm and loving hug goodbye before I dialled Lorraine’s number\\nfor her. My heart was beating fast with excitement.\\n\\nAs she held the receiver, Doris’s face lit up in joy at the sound of her friend’s\\nvoice. While Doris’s own voice was old and I knew Lorraine’s was too, the spirit\\nin that phone call was instantly like two young women. They were laughing in\\nno time and chatting non-stop. I tidied the room up a bit, pottering around,\\nunable to extract myself from this incredible happiness. Eventually though I did\\nleave. At the door, I waved quietly goodbye to Doris, who has radiant. She\\nstopped talking for a moment, asking Lorraine to wait and said to me, “Thank\\nyou, Sweetheart. Thank you”. I nodded while smiling so much my face ached.\\nWalking down the corridor I could still hear Doris laughing until the door had\\n\\x0cclosed properly. The smile didn’t leave my face all the way home.\\n\\nIt was a glorious day and a swim was beckoning. The high stayed with me\\nwhile I enjoyed the water flowing around me, as I dipped and swam for a couple\\nof hours. At home, just after sunset, I received a phone call from Rebecca, the\\nlovely staff member I had met the night I worked there and had first met Doris.\\n\\nDear Doris had passed away later that afternoon in her sleep.\\n\\nTears of sadness fell instantly, but there was joy too. After all, she had died\\nhappy, the dear lady.\\n\\nIt is amazing how a little bit of time can change a person’s life. When I think\\nabout the lonely woman I met that first night to the person who I hugged\\ngoodbye to on her last day, no amount of money could substitute the satisfaction\\nthis gave me.\\n\\nThere are thousands of beautiful, but very lonely people in nursing homes all\\nover the world. There are also many young people whose lives are now confined\\nto nursing homes. Young or old though, a couple of hours a week of a new\\nfriendship can make all of the difference to these people and to their final\\nchapter. Of course, keeping people out of nursing homes in the first place is\\npreferred, though sadly, not always possible. There are many people in homes\\nwho shouldn’t be there; people just disposed of, in a way. It is awful to witness.\\nA bit of time given though has the potential to change these people’s lives\\nimmensely.\\n\\nFor me, the timing of Doris’s departure was perfect. Simply, it was her time to\\ngo and she had been happy. We had played the role we were meant to in each\\nother’s lives and for that, I will always be grateful. She was a darling woman.\\nLorraine and I met soon after. The phone call between them had gone on for\\nages, she said. Both had parted with great happiness. We sat under trees at a café,\\ntalking happily about Doris and life in general, until it was time to drive Lorraine\\nhome. It was lovely to have been able to meet her friend. Certainly, it had been\\nbeautiful to know Doris too.\\n\\nAnd hopefully of course, our dear friend was able to meet up with her other\\nfriends when she reached the other side.\\n\\x0cTRUE FRIENDS\\neter\\n\\nThe hectic pace of Sydney was wearing me down a bit. No house-sits were on\\nthe horizon to keep me there, so I moved down south to experience another\\nchapter in Melbourne. It had been several years since I had left, so it was lovely\\nto be back enjoying the delights of such a wonderfully creative city and to see\\nold friends. My house-sitting reputation also arrived before I did, so my calendar\\nhad bookings again in no time.\\n\\nThe first house I lived in though was the holiday house of Marie, my boss at\\nthe pre-natal centre back in Sydney. It was about an hour south of Melbourne, on\\nthe lovely Mornington Peninsula and it had her energy all through it, making me\\nfeel at home instantly. It was autumn when I arrived and the first couple of\\nweeks were spent walking rugged cliffs as the water lapped below me. Walking\\nlong distances while being rugged up in a big coat and hat, with cold ocean\\nwinds gusting by, left me feeling very alive. I enjoyed walking like this and did it\\nwhile I could. Then snug inside, sitting by an open fire, my cosy evenings were\\nspent writing and playing guitar.\\n\\nAs much as I could have done this forever, income was needed too, which is\\nwhat brought me to caring for Elizabeth. In some ways, her situation was\\nheartbreaking to me, but I was learning to accept we all have different lessons to\\nlearn. What may appear as tragic situations to others, were also great\\nopportunities for growth and learning for the person involved.\\n\\nWorking through my own stuff was teaching me to find the gifts in the\\nlearning and I was coming to find a lot of blessings through my past. Many good\\nthings were discovered, gifts that could not have come to me had I been raised in\\na perfect home situation, if such a thing really existed. Strength, forgiveness,\\ncompassion, kindness, and many other lessons had been offered to me through\\nmy circumstances, all of which I was not only grateful for but were shaping me\\ninto a better person every day.\\n\\nSo I had to detach a little with the clients and accept I did not know what they\\nwere here to learn. For whatever reasons they had attracted the life they had, it\\nwasn’t up to me to save them. I was there to bring them loving care, friendship,\\nacceptance, and gentleness in their final weeks. If this helped them to find their\\n\\x0cpeace, as it sometimes did, then it made my work even more satisfying. As they\\nsay, it is in giving we receive and I was definitely receiving many blessings in\\nthis field.\\n\\nWorking with the dying was an honour too. Through all of their reminiscing\\nand stories, my own life was being transformed. To be exposed at such an age to\\nthe insights they discovered about themselves was an incredible gift. I was\\nalready implementing much of the learning from my clients into my own life by\\nnow, without having to wait until I too was on my deathbed and then regretting\\nthe same things. Arriving at each new client’s home, I was stepping into a whole\\nfresh world of learning for myself, all over again. Each home was a different\\nclassroom, with either new lessons on offer or similar lessons from different\\nperspectives. Either way, I was absorbing a great deal.\\n\\nElizabeth was not an elderly woman, only about fifty-five. She had been an\\nalcoholic for the past fifteen years and was now dying from an associated illness.\\nWhile she was still resting on the morning I arrived, her son gave me the run-\\ndown of the home and of her condition. He also explained how the family had\\ndecided not to tell her she was dying. “Oh boy,” I thought, “here I go again”.\\n\\nThrough my desire for self-improvement and inner peace, I always tried to\\nlive as much as possible in the present moment. In the case of Elizabeth, I\\nrealised this was going to be the only way through. If she asked me if she was\\ndying, I would deal with it at the time, rather than wonder how to deal with it in\\nthe meantime, accepting that she may never ask — but I wasn’t going to lie to her.\\n\\nConfusion and despair surrounded Elizabeth. The family had removed all of\\nthe alcohol from inside of the home, locking it in a cupboard in the garage,\\nwhich they helped themselves to whenever they wished. As she was ill and\\ndying, they decided to remove it from her access completely. This was one of the\\nthings I found heartbreaking. She was dying anyway so why put her through the\\npain of withdrawing, on top of things? But again, it wasn’t my life, nor was it my\\ndecision.\\n\\nAlcoholism in others was something I had been exposed to at too young an\\nage. Then later working in the hospitality industry, on the island and while\\ntravelling, I was exposed to it even more. Alcohol doesn’t bring out the best in\\nanyone and not only ruins the goodness of the alcoholic him or herself, it ruins\\nfamilies, friendships, careers, and the innocence of children exposed to it. This is\\nthe case with other drug addictions too. The only true thing that brings out the\\nbest in anyone is love.\\n\\nAlcoholism is also an illness though. And while it is one that can be treated,\\n\\x0cthe sufferer needs ongoing and loving support to break the patterns, and to start\\nbelieving in themselves and their potential for a better life. Taking a chronic\\nalcoholic off their addiction, with no loving support or explanation, appeared to\\nbe a pretty awful thing to me.\\n\\nAll Elizabeth knew was that she was ill. Her energy was exhausted. She\\nneeded assistance with almost everything and her appetite was fading. She was\\nalso desperately missing the alcohol. The family had only told her that the doctor\\nsaid to take her off the drink ‘for a while’. It took some strength for me to not\\njudge them, particularly when I saw them sneaking alcohol into their own bodies\\nregularly while denying a dying woman of it. Who was I to say though, what her\\nlessons in life were to be?\\n\\nHer general physical weakness would not have allowed Elizabeth to be out\\nand about anymore. The family had also banned some of her friends from\\nvisiting, as they were drinkers. It was not surprising then to see Elizabeth\\nexperiencing despair and confusion, having had all of her pleasures removed\\nfrom her.\\n\\nShe accepted the ban of her drinking friends with quiet resignation, though it\\nhad removed more than that from her. Elizabeth had been on the boards of a\\ncouple of charitable societies before becoming so ill. These friends were her link\\nto the outside world and to her former life.\\n\\nAfter six or seven weeks together, her strength was disappearing even more\\nsignificantly, while her need for rest increased. Elizabeth was quite funny, in an\\nunobtrusive way. Very dry humour came out of her at some of the most\\nunexpected moments. Sometimes one of her remarks would come to mind at\\nhome after a shift and I would find myself smiling as I thought of her. We had\\ngrown to like each other and had established workable routines, within the\\nrestraints of her illness. One of those was our cup of tea every morning in the\\nsunroom. It was the nicest room in the house by far and at this time of year, the\\nsun shining in was glorious. It was while in the sunroom one morning that things\\nmoved to a new level between us.\\n\\n“Bronnie, why do you think I am not getting better? I am not drinking but I am\\nstill getting weaker by the day. What do you think?” Elizabeth asked.\\n\\nLooking at her directly and lovingly, I replied tenderly with a couple of\\nquestions. “What do you think is the reason? I am sure you’ve thought about it a\\nbit before now?” I was very gentle with her, but needed to know her line of\\nthinking first.\\n\\n“T dare not say what I am thinking,” she sighed. “It is too big to grasp. Yet\\n\\x0cdeep down I know the answer anyway.”\\n\\nWe sat in silence for a while, watching the birds out of the window, the sun\\nwarm on us both. “If I ask you, will you tell me? I really need some honesty\\nhere,” she admitted. Lovingly, I nodded.\\n\\n“Is it what I think?” she asked, but with the question almost unfinished. I\\nwaited, sending her love, seeing if she wanted to go on. She did. “Oh God, it is,”\\nshe said, answering herself with a sigh. “I am dying aren’t I? Kicking the\\nproverbial bucket. Flying with the angels. Passing on or over or whatever it is.\\nDying! I am dying. I’m right, aren’t I?” With a heart tangled up in the bitter-\\nsweetness of her now knowing, I slowly nodded.\\n\\nSilently we both sat watching the birds until Elizabeth was ready to talk again.\\nIt was a while before that happened, but I had grown used to comfortable\\nsilences with my clients. They had so much to think about and to absorb, that\\nsometimes conversation could just get in the way. There was no need to fill the\\nsilence at such a time. They would talk when they were ready. After some time,\\nElizabeth did.\\n\\nShe said she had suspected this for a while now and how she was frustrated\\nwith her family’s lack of honesty. Taking her friends and social life away was\\ncruel she said, to which I somewhat agreed. Elizabeth understood she wasn’t\\nstrong enough to go out of the house, but said she would have liked to seen her\\nfriends from time to time. Acquaintances dropped in sometimes, people the\\nfamily approved of and trusted to come without alcohol. They were pleasant\\npeople, she said, but there was no closeness.\\n\\nOnce we reached this level of honesty, our conversations flowed unhindered.\\nThere was no time for holding back. So Elizabeth and I found ourselves enjoying\\neach other’s company more each day. After years of being so withdrawn, I often\\nsurprised myself now, by how easily I expressed personal thoughts. With death\\non her doorstep, Elizabeth too enjoyed the openness of our constant exchanges.\\nHer initial reaction was anger that her family had not told her she was dying.\\nEventually, it shifted to acceptance. She expressed that the controlling behaviour\\nfrom her family had possibly been fear based. For that, she was able to forgive\\nthem.\\n\\nHowever, she was unable to pretend that she didn’t know she was dying, and\\naddressed this with them on one of my days off. It brought them all closer, with\\nthe family feeling relief that none of them had had to tell her the big news. It was\\ngood for me to hear this and not to be under anyone’s wrath for my honesty but\\nthey remained fixed. Her drinking friends could only contact her by phone.\\n\\x0cElizabeth was evolving enormously though and became accepting of this, now\\nwithout resignation. She admitted to me, though wouldn’t admit to her family, it\\nwas probably only drinking that had truly held that circle of friends together\\nanyway. Drawing on my own experiences, I told Elizabeth how several years\\nearlier my friendships had changed immensely, when I began extracting my life\\nfrom the pot-smoking world. It had sorted out who my friends truly were and\\nwho were mates simply because we shared a smoke together. Some people who I\\nthought were quite good friends were actually not comfortable around me at all,\\nif I was not stoned with them. It didn’t make anyone a bad person. But when I\\nstopped moving in that world, I saw it was only the smoke that had kept some\\nlinks joined. Without that, there was no longer a common denominator to hold\\nour friendships together. So we had drifted off naturally, in entirely different\\ndirections.\\n\\n“T wish I’d stayed in touch with my friends, my real friends,” she said, as I\\nrecognised the words from previous people. “My drinking moved me out of\\nthose circles and now fifteen years later, there is little to connect on with my old\\nfriends. They have all moved away anyway.”\\n\\nWhile discussing the acquaintances who were allowed to visit, Elizabeth said\\nshe wouldn’t really call them ‘friends’. We spoke about how loosely that word is\\nused at times and how there are so many different levels of friends. I had begun\\nto think of some of my own ‘friends’ more as warm acquaintances lately. It\\ndidn’t mean I thought less of them. They were still a blessing in my life but\\nhaving been to some pretty dark places in myself by now, I understood what a\\nreal friend was. It is easy to have a lot of acquaintances and I did love those\\npeople for the enjoyable role we played in each other’s lives. When it comes to\\nthe crunch though, not many people can hang around through the very worst of\\nthe pain with someone else. Those who do are truly friends.\\n\\n“Tt is about having the right friends for the right occasion I suppose,” Elizabeth\\npondered. “I simply don’t have the right friends for this occasion, for my\\ndeparture. Do you know what I mean?”\\n\\nAgreeing, I shared with her that while it was not at all such a serious scenario\\nas her situation, I held a very clear memory of such an occasion for me, of\\nmissing the right friends for the right occasion. Because of this memory, I could\\ndefinitely understand that there are different levels of friendships and\\nassociations, and sometimes it is a specific quality of friendship we yearn for,\\nrather than just anyone.\\n\\nFollowing the years on the island, I worked for a short time in the printing\\n\\x0ccompany in Europe. My co-workers were nice people and I appreciated the\\nopportunities that were presented to me, opening my world up even more. The\\nisland community had been like a family though. Whenever any of us went\\naway, on a holiday to the mainland for instance, we would all say how beautiful\\nit was to come home to our family on the island.\\n\\nNew friends were made in Europe, though in hindsight I would now call them\\npleasant acquaintances. Through these people, I ended up on a trip across a\\ncouple of countries, to the Italian Alps with three others around my age. We had\\nrented a cabin high up in the Alps, with no electricity or running water. It was\\ngorgeous and unlike any terrain of my beloved Australia, which has its own\\nmagnificence, but is hugely different. So I found the Alps overwhelmingly\\nbeautiful.\\n\\nBathing was done in a flow of water running down the mountain. Though it\\nwas summer, the water was freezing. It was really just melting snow forming a\\ndownhill stream. As the water rushed down all around me I sat in its flow,\\ngasping for breath. All the while though, I was still enjoying the magnificent\\nviews, and feeling invigorated. But the water was absolutely freezing, biting as it\\nhit me, rushing past.\\n\\nWhenever I had found the courage to swim in a freezing river or ocean, I’d\\nalways felt a bit playful after, a bit like a dog after they’ve had a bath. They rush\\naround like mad, all crazy and energetic, regardless of whether they’ve enjoyed\\nthe bath or not. That’s sort of what bathing in this freezing mountain stream did\\nto me. It left me feeling ridiculously silly afterwards.\\n\\nSo I was a bit off my head with excitement and playfulness after drying off,\\ngetting dressed, and retuming to the cabin. Carrying on with good-natured\\nhumour, entertaining myself immensely, and sharing silly anecdotes with my\\nnew friends, I realised every single one of my jokes was totally lost on them.\\nThe worried smiles that said, “What is she on about?” told me so in a second.\\nTheir puzzled faces sort of just cracked me up even more. At least I was\\nenjoying the jokes anyway. They were happy and lovely people. It was just that\\nthe humour of our cultures was so different. In an instant, I missed my old\\nfriends with painful longing. They would not only have related to the silliness\\nbut would have been cracking up with me by now, adding their own jokes,\\nturning it all into an even greater laugh.\\n\\nThat evening, after a massive afternoon hike to the top of a mountain, we all\\nsat by the light of lanterns as we ate and chatted a while. It was nice. Not long\\nafter though, everyone retired for the night, everyone except for me. The hike\\n\\x0chad been amazing and I was still in a jubilant mood. Really, all I wanted to be\\ndoing was sitting around with friends and just generally having a laugh, to wind\\nup a fantastic day. Certainly I didn’t want to be going to bed yet anyway.\\n\\nBut all was now quiet in the hut as my friends slept. Carrying a lantern into\\nmy little room, I placed it on the table and spent the next two hours writing. In\\nthe distance I heard bells ringing as cows moved about in the night. I smiled in\\nbliss that here I was, in a gorgeous little cabin, writing by lantern light high up in\\nthe Alps, and listening to sound of distant cow bells. It was a world away from\\nmy own world, and while I was overwhelmed by the peace of the moment, it\\nmade me miss my old friends terribly.\\n\\nIt was a perfect night but with the wrong people. There were plenty of reasons\\nto like each of my friends on this trip and I did. I was experiencing a very special\\nmoment in myself though and I wanted to be sharing it with the right people,\\nwith friends who truly knew me. Of course, this was never going to happen. So I\\nsavoured the blessing of the moment all to myself instead.\\n\\nI knew what Elizabeth was now talking about when she said she wished she\\nhad the right friends around. Sometimes there are just particular people who\\nunderstand you, no matter what — and these are old friends. It was like that for\\nme that night in the Alps and it was like that now for Elizabeth as she began\\naccepting that her life was coming to a close.\\n\\nWhen her doctor came to visit, I asked him privately if it would make any\\ndifference to Elizabeth’s condition if she were still drinking. He shook his head.\\n“No, she’s on the home straight now regardless. I told her family if she wants a\\nlittle brandy of an evening to allow it. Are they not?” he asked me. I shook my\\nhead. He restated it would make little difference now.\\n\\nLater I spoke to her family quietly about it. But again, it had been a family\\ndecision and no, they would definitely not be giving her any drink. They then\\nwent onto explain why. It seems that the Elizabeth I was spending time with and\\nthe Elizabeth they knew when she had been drinking were two entirely different\\npersonalities. In fact, they couldn’t believe what a pleasant person she was again\\nnow, as they hadn’t seen this side of her for at least fifteen years.\\n\\nOver the next couple of weeks, I asked her more about her drinking habit, if\\nshe brought it up. Elizabeth said that as much as she was still craving it now, she\\nwas kind of glad too to be able to remember who she was before alcohol had\\ntaken over her life. It had begun easily enough. She’d always had a few wines\\nwith the family at dinner and had done so for years with no problem.\\n\\nThen she became active socially, being on the boards of various charities. She\\n\\x0cadmitted that many people she met through these scenes did not drink\\nexcessively at all, but she had been drawn to those who did. She didn’t feel\\nnoticed at home anymore. But felt like her presence mattered to these new\\nfriends. Now that she was feeling clearer, she realised they were all just as needy\\nas her, all needing validation through this circle of friends and their drinking.\\n\\nElizabeth said alcohol gave her confidence, or when she was drunk she\\nthought it did, but she became outspoken, loud, and eventually quite bitter and\\nnasty to others. This is what had made her lose her original circle of old friends.\\nThey had tried to reach her with love and support, trying to help her see her own\\ndemise, something they were watching with heartache, but she was arrogant with\\nthem all, eventually pushing every last one of them away.\\n\\nThis only validated to her drunken mind just how loyal her new friends were\\nwho didn’t judge her for her drinking habit. Of course this was because they\\nwere drinking too. The other reasoning for her drinking that she had justified to\\nherself during these years, was that at least now her family noticed her. While it\\nmay not have been in a positive way, at least she didn’t feel ignored like she used\\nto, before she had started drinking excessively. Her loss of control ensured they\\nhad to start paying attention.\\n\\nThe more Elizabeth’s capabilities declined due to alcoholism, the more her\\nfamily had to help her and the worse she eventually began to feel. It had begun\\nwith her enjoying their attention. But in the end, she was incapable of helping\\nherself and this lack of control left her feeling even more insecure and negative\\nabout who she now was. So while in the early days she could see she was hurt\\nabout her family not valuing her presence or opinion, in the end, she came to\\ntruly depend on them and hated herself for it. This just perpetuated the cycle of\\nlow self-esteem even more.\\n\\n“You know, not everyone wants to get well either Bronnie. And for a long time\\nI didn’t. The role of the sick person gave me an identity. Obviously I was\\nholding myself back from being a better person this way. But I was getting\\nattention, and trying to fool myself this made me happier than being courageous\\nand well.” This admission from Elizabeth was the hindsight of a woman who\\nwas now on a fast track to wisdom. Being dry for almost three months and\\nfacing the fact that she was dying was changing her enormously.\\n\\nKnowing Elizabeth’s full and honest story about her addiction also helped me\\nto understand her and her family more. In the end, their severe actions had\\nactually helped her to become a better person again. While I may not have done\\nit in such a closed and secretive fashion, I came to respect that they were really\\n\\x0ctrying to help her and themselves. And they were successful in doing so. Part of\\ntheir success too though, was Elizabeth herself. Facing her death had made her\\nlook at life very differently and she had courageously embraced her learning.\\n\\nDuring her last two weeks, I watched some extraordinary healing unfold\\nbetween Elizabeth and her family. One of the most beautiful things I was\\nlearning through palliative care was to never underestimate anyone’s capacity for\\nlearning. The peace I witnessed Elizabeth find was something I had also seen in\\nprevious clients. It was a very gratifying thing.\\n\\nAbout a week before she died, I spoke with her husband and one of her sons\\nabout Elizabeth’s regret of losing her old friends and wondered if it might not be\\ntoo late to reach some of them, even if they could just speak on the phone. By\\nnow, there was no concern about friends sneaking alcohol into Elizabeth. It was\\nthe least of everyone’s concerns. Her comfort was all that mattered now and as\\nthe family had healed so much, they immediately jumped to the idea.\\n\\nA couple of days later, two beautiful, healthy and lovely women came in to\\nElizabeth’s room, just after I had sat her up comfortably offering her some tea.\\nOne of them was now living in the mountains outside of the city, about an hour\\naway. The other had flown to Melbourne from the Sunshine Coast in\\nQueensland, as soon as she had heard the news. Now they sat around Elizabeth’s\\nbed, talking with her, holding hands and smiling.\\n\\nLeaving them to their privacy and me to a quiet tear of joy, I left the room. As\\nI was doing so though, I heard Elizabeth apologise to them both and their instant\\nforgiveness returned. It was past. It didn’t matter they said. Her husband Roger\\nand I sat out in the kitchen, both of us teary but delighted.\\n\\nThe friends stayed for a couple of hours, by which time Elizabeth was both\\nexhilarated and completely exhausted. She fell into a deep sleep instantly and I\\nhad no chance to chat with her before going home. When I returned a couple of\\ndays later, she was very weak, but wanted to talk.\\n\\n“Wasn’t that wonderful? Oh to see their faces again,” she smiled with delight.\\nUnable to lift her head off the pillows now, she looked across to me sitting\\nbeside her.\\n\\n“It was beautiful,” I told her.\\n\\n“Don’t lose touch with the friends you value most Bronnie. Those who accept\\nyou as who you are, and who know you very well, are worth more than anything\\nin the end. This is a woman speaking from experience,” she insisted lightly,\\nsmiling at me through her illness. “Don’t let life get in the way. Just always\\nknow where to find them and let them know you appreciate them in the\\n\\x0cmeantime. Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable either. I wasted some time in not\\nbeing able to let them all know what a mess I was.” Elizabeth had forgiven\\nherself and was able to let go of her own judgment. She had found her peace and\\nshe had found her friends.\\n\\nWhen her last morning came, I was adding some moisture to her lips. Her\\nmouth was no longer producing saliva properly and she was struggling to speak,\\nnot that she had the energy to anyway. As I finished, she looked to me smiling\\nthen mouthed the words ‘Thank you’. Looking at her, I returned the same\\ngratitude with a smile. Then I kissed her on the forehead and held her hand for a\\nmoment, which she squeezed.\\n\\nHer room was full of people who loved her. All of her family was there, as\\nwere the two delightful ladies I had met a few days earlier. I stepped back and\\nallowed her to be surrounded by those she had loved the most.\\n\\nJust in time, Elizabeth had let love back into her life and appreciated the value\\nof her family and true friends. She departed this Earth surrounded by love,\\nknowing her presence had been valued enormously and that her friends knew she\\nloved them too.\\n\\x0cALLOW YOURSELF\\neter\\n\\nAs far as work went, looking after Harry was the easiest time I ever had. Not\\nonly was he a wonderful person, but his family insisted on doing everything.\\nThree of Harry’s five daughters lived in the same suburb and would bring his\\nmain meals over most days and one of his sons insisted on caring for his dad\\nhimself. Questioning the need for me to be there at all, the daughters and other\\nsons assured me they definitely wanted me there.\\n\\nIt meant though, that much of my time was spent reading or writing. There is\\nonly so much housework to be done in an already clean and tidy home, with its\\nonly tenant bedridden. I did create a couple of delicious soup recipes in his\\nkitchen though.\\n\\nHarry had bushy eyebrows, hairy ears, a red face and an honest laugh. We\\nliked each other immediately. Within the first minute of meeting, we had both\\ncracked a joke with each other. So it was an easy, natural association from the\\nstart.\\n\\nHis son, Brian, was a different story though. He was very highly strung. Harry\\nand Brian had fallen out years ago and while contact had remained between\\nthem, their bond was never quite the same. The rest of the family explained it as\\nbeing Brian’s fault. I wasn’t there all those years ago though, nor had I walked in\\neither Harry or Brian’s shoes, so I don’t know. It didn’t matter to me either way.\\nBut it was obvious that Brian was now trying to make up for lost time by\\ninsisting he be his father’s primary carer.\\n\\nBrian interrupted any attempt I made to help Harry. By now, I was very good\\nat finding the right position for a client’s comfort. It was an intuitive thing and\\none many clients commented on. But family often rearranged pillows and\\nsupports out of kindness, not realising how sensitive a person’s body is at this\\ntime, and how the slightest adjustment can undo the only tiny bit of comfort they\\nhave.\\n\\nWhen his son reluctantly went off to work every day for a few hours, the first\\nthing I would do was to get Harry comfortable again. If there was a tiny moment\\nof time during the day when I could attend to him without being hounded out by\\nhis son, literally, the first thing Harry would ask was for me to quickly adjust his\\n\\x0cpillows.\\n\\nEach afternoon though, we had those few hours together before the family\\narrived back en-masse for dinner, even though by now their dad was hardly\\neating. These hours were wonderful and what Harry affectionately called ‘the\\npeace hours’. While I attended to his physical needs, we would chat and laugh.\\nThis was usually followed by a cup of tea and some more chat.\\n\\nHarry had lost his wife twenty years earlier but had come to continue living\\nhis life well. He had enjoyed his work, though became even busier on retiring,\\njoining a couple of sporting and social clubs. While his illness was terminal,\\nprior to this he had experienced amazing health for his whole life.\\n\\n“T respected the gift of health I was given,” Harry told me, “by staying active\\nand not believing some quota of years saying I should be acting this way or that.\\nPeople make themselves old before their time, you know”. Despite being a dying\\nperson, Harry was the healthiest man of eighty years I had ever seen. The illness\\nwas certainly starting to wear him down, but evidence of his prior fitness was\\nstill apparent. Massaging his legs for example, muscle tone from all of his\\nwalking could still be seen.\\n\\n“When you’re retired and your children are raising their own children, the\\nneed for friends is even more important,” Harry said. “So when my wife died,\\nGod rest her soul, I joined the rowing club. Then I joined a bushwalking club. I\\ndon’t know how I ever had time to work!”\\n\\nHarry very much believed in the importance of extended family, that\\ngrandparents are an integral part of children’s lives and should be given plenty of\\nopportunity to spend time with them. It was obvious in his relationships with his\\ngrandchildren who visited him daily that he had a very positive and loving\\ninfluence on them all.\\n\\n“My family comes first but you need people your own age too. If it weren’t for\\nthe friends I’ve made through the clubs, I would have been a very lonely old\\nperson. I wouldn’t have been lonely for company, as I have my children and\\ngrandchildren, but lonely for like-minded company of people my own age.”\\n\\nHours were spent chatting in his room, until the late afternoon sun would warn\\nus of the peace hours being almost over. The family would soon be descending\\non us again, but Harry always talked for as long as he could. He said he didn’t\\nunderstand why people left it too late to realise the importance of friends. Also,\\nwhile it was beautiful when elderly people still managed to hold a loving and\\nrespected position within their family, he grew frustrated that so many of them\\nhadn’t left time for friendship along the way too.\\n\\x0c“They’ ll realise it too late,” he insisted. “But it’s not just my generation. I look\\nat the younger ones too, who get so caught up and busy, not taking just a little bit\\nof time out for themselves now and then, to do things that make them happy on\\nan individual basis. They lose who they really are completely. A little time with\\nfriends reminds them of who they are when they are not mum, dad, grandma, or\\ngrandfather. Do you understand what I am saying?”\\n\\nAgreeing that I had seen plenty of people go down that road, I also said I had\\nseen others who had maintained just a slight bit of time out for themselves and\\nwere much happier people. They were also much better company to be around.\\n\\n“Exactly!” He laughed, slapping the bed in agreement. “Good friendships\\nstimulate us. The beauty of friendship is that these people take us as we are, on\\nthe things we have in common. Friendship is about being accepted as who you\\nare, not as who someone else wants you to be, like a partner or family. We must\\nmaintain our friendships, my dear girl.”\\n\\nBy the stream of visitors that came to visit Harry regularly, it was obvious this\\nman walked his talk. His friends were all happy, jovial people and brought great\\njoy with them. Equally respectful of his illness though, they accepted that\\nsometimes he was resting and could not be disturbed.\\n\\nOn another afternoon, Harry asked me about my own friendships. So I filled\\nhim in on my close friends and explained how some of my other friendships\\nwere changing lately, as was I.\\n\\n“Well, that’s natural too,” he said. “Friends will come and go throughout life.\\nThat’s why we should value them while they are here. Sometimes, you simply\\nfinish learning or sharing what you were meant to through each other. But others\\nwill stay the distance, and that history and understanding is a comforting thing\\nwhen you’re at the end of the road.”\\n\\nDuring these talks we both agreed that women approach friendships much\\ndifferently to men. Women value friendships in a stronger way emotionally, that\\nis, the friendships grow closer with a lot of talk about emotional things. Men\\nneed friendships for talking too, he said. But they do this best when they are\\ndoing things together, like playing tennis, cycling, or doing something active.\\nMen enjoy friendships where they can work things out, resolve problems,\\nwhether physical or emotional, and this often happens best when they are active.\\n\\n“Like building a fence around a paddock together,” I suggested.\\n\\nHarry cracked up laughing. “My, my. You can take the girl out of the country,\\nbut you can’t take the country out of the girl. Yes, a very rural example Bronnie,\\nbut exactly. Building a fence or doing something manual together is a bonding\\n\\x0cthing for men.”\\n\\nHe carried on laughing and said if I ever wanted to bond with a good-looking\\nman, all I had to do was to help him to build a fence. I told him I’d keep it in\\nmind.\\n\\nSharing some of his favourite stories about mate-ship with me, Harry\\nreinforced the blessings of the friendships still existing. Every day lovely friends\\nvisited him. They were now operating a roster amongst themselves though, so as\\nto not exhaust him. This way, everyone still had a chance to spend time with\\nHarry. It was loyal and wonderful.\\n\\nWe both admitted that through these peace hours, we were each receiving a\\nnew friendship into our lives too, each other. It frustrated him, he said, to know I\\nwas out in another part of the house for the rest of the day, just reading or\\nwriting, when I could be in his room chatting. In total agreement, I laughed. But\\nhe understood, as did I, Brian’s need to make amends and the desire to assist his\\nfather. Harry didn’t want Brian to be carrying any guilt, though he was sure he\\nstill would, unfortunately. So he was happy to go with it and allow his son to feel\\nneeded during their last weeks together. “Even if he can’t arrange the pillows\\nwell,” he sighed.\\n\\nHarry was philosophical about his illness and what was to come. He had lived\\nhis life to the fullest, he said, and was ready to see what lay beyond. While we\\ndid speak about his approaching passing sometimes, he still steered many of the\\nconversations to the subject of friends: the memories, the value of them, and the\\nnecessity of them for happiness and acceptance. He also encouraged me to share\\nsome of my favourite memories with him about my friendships so far. “Start\\nwith one from your childhood. Let’s hear where you’re coming from,” he said,\\nthen laughed in delight when my story began in a rural setting, a paddock of\\nwheat.\\n\\nBy the time I was twelve, we had moved from a cattle and lucerne growing\\nfarm, to a sheep and wheat farm. It was miles from town, under a magnificently\\nhuge sky. About a year later my first dog disappeared suddenly, when she was\\nseven. We think it may have been a snake’s bite, as we never found her. This\\nwasn’t surprising as the farm was so large. It was devastating for me though. A\\nfew months later my folks bought me a new dog. She was a little white Maltese\\nTerrier, who neglected to realise that she was supposed to be a housedog.\\nInstead, she spent her days chasing the sheep dogs, the border collies and\\nkelpies, over paddocks near and far.\\n\\nMy closest friend through my high school years and for a long time after was\\n\\x0cFiona. Although she lived in town, much of our time was spent out at the farm. I\\nstayed in town at her parent’s place a bit too, particularly as we grew a little\\nolder and there were boys to be kissed. One of the main things that linked Fiona\\nand I over the years though was our love of walking. I cannot think how many\\nmiles we ended up walking together over the decades of our friendship: beaches,\\nrainforests, city streets, foreign countries, bush tracks, you name it. It all started\\nwith walking those paddocks of wheat.\\n\\nAs usual, my dog and a couple of the other dogs came along with us. It was\\nnot particularly strange to turn around and see a cat or two also following. While\\nwe girls stuck to the track that led to the furthest paddocks away, the dogs would\\nrun through the wheat. This was fine while the wheat was low but as it grew, my\\nlittle dog became invisible. Fiona and I were given the most beautiful comedy\\nsketch this day.\\n\\nFollowing the big dogs, which we could see clearly above the tallest sections\\nof crop, was a trail of movement in the wheat behind as my little dog ran blindly\\nafter the big dogs. Then every now and then the movement would stop. A little\\nwhite head would pop up and look around like a submarine telescope coming out\\nof the water, until it spotted the other dogs. It then disappeared below again into\\nthe wheat, blazing another trail of movement in the new direction. Then the\\nmovement would stop, up would pop the little white head, spot the target again,\\ndisappear below and run on. This went on for ages and by the end of it, every\\ntime we saw the little white head pop up and look around, Fiona and I would\\nbreak into hysterical teenage giggling all over again. Our cheeks ached from\\nlaughing and as tears ran down our faces, we leaned on each other, holding the\\nother up before spotting the dog popping up yet again, and doubling over in\\nlaughter even more. In the end, we could hardly even stand up.\\n\\nSharing this simple but precious memory took me back to the value of\\nfriendship in an instant. Harry and I laughed together, as I missed that innocence\\nof youth and the carefree, uninhibited laughter I used to share with Fiona.\\n“Where is she now?” Harry asked. I went onto explain that she was living in\\nanother country and we had lost touch. Life had moved on, I said, and there were\\nnow others in my life who I was closer to. Other factors had also affected our\\nfriendship, other people, but also other tastes and gradual differences in\\nlifestyles. Harry agreed that you can’t go back, but maybe life would bring our\\npaths around again. Having already observed many cycles in life, I agreed it was\\npossible. But either way it didn’t matter. I valued the memories and wished\\nFiona well; silently thanking her for the learning and friendship we had once\\n\\x0cshared.\\n\\nMany of my best memories of friendships were of walking, talking and\\nlaughing. Over the next week or two, I shared with Harry stories from some of\\nthese other friendships. He had also been a keen walker and shared some of his\\nown with me, of places he’d walked and of friends with whom he had shared the\\nexperiences with. I could imagine any group being brightened by Harry’s\\nlaughter as they walked. It made me smile at the thought and when he asked\\nwhat I was smiling at, I was happy to tell him. Harry agreed they had always\\nshared some great laughs while walking.\\n\\nAs it was, I was to leave Harry the following week to go on a long walk\\nmyself. I hadn’t been sure if he would still be alive when I had booked into it. So\\nwhile I was looking very forward to getting out of the city, I was also a little sad\\nto be leaving him, not sure if he would still be here when I returned. When I told\\nHarry what I was doing though, he wholeheartedly agreed with enthusiasm and\\nsaid he would be there with me in spirit whether he was alive or not.\\n\\nThe walk was in a remote area and was held each year, always ending at the\\nsame lake. Each time a different tributary was followed though. This particular\\nyear it was starting on some farms where the very mouth of a river began. We\\nwould follow that river, much of it now just dry riverbeds, and eventually end up\\nat the lake.\\n\\nThe concept of the walk was to give the participants the opportunity to heal\\nwith the Earth, as we walked the paths trodden by ancient civilisations. Rivers\\nwere like highways then, thoroughfares at least, where tribes would live and\\nwalk along its banks, from one place to the next. An Aboriginal Elder blessed us\\nas we all partook in a cleansing smoke ceremony, then off we went, walking for\\nsix days.\\n\\nWe all fell into our own rhythm. There were about a dozen of us. Some walked\\nin groups and talked all the way. Others meandered in and out of conversation.\\nSome stopped and took photos of everything, and some of us walked more\\nalone. Each night, a couple of volunteers would turn up with the trailer carrying\\nour gear and we’d establish a camp. Then around a peaceful campfire a\\ncommunal dinner was prepared, while beautiful friendships formed under a\\nmagnificent blanket of stars.\\n\\nWith every footstep, the connection with the Earth increased. While I enjoyed\\nconversations when we stopped for a break, I found more enjoyment in walking\\nalone and my pace ensured this anyway. Having done so much walking in the\\npast, my natural rhythm carried me ahead of the main group. One other walker,\\n\\x0cthe wise and loving soul who originally started these walks, was always ahead of\\nme, also walking to his own rhythm.\\n\\nThe time alone, just walking and walking, was also great for finding clarity\\nwithin myself again. During this time I realised I didn’t want to keep house-\\nsitting for much longer. Something in me was starting to think about having my\\nown kitchen again. All of the moving I had once loved was starting to exhaust\\nme. A new seed was planted, not with big fanfare, just a quiet acceptance within\\nthat some things were changing. I walked on peacefully.\\n\\nIt is rare to be able to walk so far in modern times as land is now separated by\\nownership. Thankfully, this was all approved of beforehand so we walked across\\nfarm after farm without any problem. In the modern rush of life, it is very easy to\\nnot be aware of the Earth beneath our feet. Sure, most of us feel a connection\\nwith the Earth when we stop and absorb the beauty of nature. To be able to walk\\nfor six days unhindered though, left me feeling a connection with the Earth I\\nhadn’t known was missing, despite all of my time previously spent in blissful\\nappreciation of the planet.\\n\\nAlong the way, we discovered carvings from ancient people and marvelled at\\nmagnificent red gums, trees hundreds of years old. There were intricate carvings,\\nas well as indentations where canoes had been crafted from their bark. This\\nevidence of past people, whose tribes were now long lost, was heartbreaking and\\ninspiring at the same time. The energy in certain places was incredibly strong too\\nand I understood why it was a walk intended for healing.\\n\\nOn top of this, much of the farmland we crossed reminded me of where I had\\ngrown up. Even the smell of sheep poo brought a flood of memories rushing\\nback and I loved being in the dry, dusty climate again, even if only temporarily.\\nWith every footstep, my fitness improved and I dreamed of returning to a world\\nwhere walking was the main means of transport. It just made more sense to me\\nthan all of the rush and bustle of modern life.\\n\\nFinding a cooling waterhole to have a swim in was a welcome relief one day,\\nwhen I had somehow lost the group briefly. Stripping off and swimming in this\\nclean, refreshing water was rejuvenating, as the water cleansed my spirit as\\nmuch as it did my body. Every moment of this week was a spiritual blessing, as\\nthe connection with nature grew more enhanced.\\n\\nThe landscape changed constantly as we walked from about eight in the\\nmorning until five or so each afternoon, then set up camp. Other signs of\\nprevious life dotted our path too. An old cart that had once become bogged in the\\nriver was now a part of the dry landscape and possibly had been for over a\\n\\x0chundred years. A stone cabin with no roof told of river dwellers in other times\\ntoo. The best though was when we saw the carvings and realised what a unique\\nhistory lesson we were all blessed with, confirming the lives of those ancient\\npeople whose footsteps we were now following.\\n\\nAfter six full days of walking and about eighty kilometres covered, we arrived\\nweary but exhilarated. It was with great sadness I said farewell to the other\\nwalkers, but with even greater sadness that the walk had finished. The following\\nday I walked for another five hours, around the dry lake itself, as I just couldn’t\\nget out of walking mode. A small music festival followed a few days later, which\\nwas organised with equal reverence as the walk. So I hung around for that and\\nthen headed back to Melbourne.\\n\\nThankfully Harry had not yet passed, so I was able to spend a little more time\\nwith him. During the ten days I was away though, the disease had taken over his\\nbody and I found him looking quite emaciated. All of his tone had left his once\\nmuscular legs, and his big round face was now gaunt with loose skin. He was\\nstill Harry though, still a delightful, beautiful man.\\n\\nBut the intensity of Brian’s desperation to look after his father had increased\\nenormously. He was even more controlling than ever and would only leave the\\nhouse for an hour maximum each afternoon. I was grateful that both Harry and I\\nhad already appreciated those peace hours before I went away, as they were\\nhardly on offer now. In addition to Brian’s obsessive behaviour, Harry was\\nsleeping much more anyway.\\n\\nAs life would have it though, Brian was called away unexpectedly one\\nmorning and had to reluctantly hand the care over to me. Thankfully it was when\\nHarry was at his brightest — not that his brightest was bright anymore. But he\\nwas awake and capable of talking a little at least.\\n\\nAt his request, I told him all about the walk and the insights I’d had into\\nmyself while I was away. He asked about the other walkers as well and any\\npositive changes they’d noticed in themselves or that I had noticed. There was\\nmuch to share.\\n\\n“And what are you doing this week in regards to friends, Bronnie?” he\\nenquired in his weakening voice. “What time are you giving of your week to\\nspend with good quality friends? That’s what I want to know.” I laughed at his\\npersistence on the subject, and said there would be plenty of time to catch up\\nwith other friends later. Right now I wanted to enjoy my time with him, Harry,\\nwho was also my friend.\\n\\n“Tt’s not enough my dear girl. You are doing what others do. Surely you have\\n\\x0clearned by now that you must take time out for you too. Find some balance and\\nmake time for your friends regularly. Do it for yourself even more than for them.\\nWe need our friends.” Harry looked at me sternly with a look of warning. But we\\nboth knew there was love behind his insistence.\\n\\nHe was right. I needed to maintain some time out with friends regularly, rather\\nthan be working all of these twelve-hour shifts and catching up with them all\\nlater. As much as I loved this work and sometimes shared some wonderful\\nlaughter with the clients and their families, it was a pretty serious world I was\\nliving in. Being around dying people and the sadness of their families needed to\\nbe balanced with some lightness that only friends could provide. Joy was\\nmissing from my life and it was only now I was able to truly acknowledge this to\\nmyself.\\n\\n“You’re right, Harry,” I admitted. He smiled and put his arms up for a hug. I\\nleant down on the bed and embraced him, smiling.\\n\\n“Tt’s not just about staying in touch with your friends, my dear girl. It is about\\ngiving yourself the gift of their company too. You understand this, don’t you?”\\nhe asked with both words and eyes.\\n\\nNodding with conviction I replied, “Yes Harry, I do”. Leaving him to his rest a\\nlittle while later, I appreciated the point he had made and the direct honesty\\nshared.\\n\\nHarry was blessed with a smooth passing. He died in his sleep a few nights\\nlater. Calling to let me know, his daughter thanked me sincerely. But as I said to\\nher, Harry gave a lot to me too. It had been my pleasure to know him.\\n\\n“Allow yourself time with your friends,” I still hear him say. The words of that\\ndear man with the bushy eyebrows, red face, and big smile live on still.\\n\\x0cREGRET 5:\\nI WISH I HAD LE'T MYSELF BE HAPPIER\\n\\nefeKyod?\\n\\nBeing an executive in a global corporation, Rosemary was a woman ahead of her\\ntime. She had moved up the ranks long before women were ever seen in these\\ntypes of roles. Prior to this though, she had lived according to society’s\\nexpectations in those days, and had married young. Unfortunately, with her\\nmarriage came physical and mental abuse. When she was left almost dying after\\none particular beating, it was time to escape for good.\\n\\nDespite it being a very valid reason to leave a marriage, divorce was still a\\nscandal in those days. So to uphold the family reputation in a town where their\\nname was well known, Rosemary had moved to the city and started afresh.\\n\\nLife had hardened her heart and her way of thinking. Self-validation and\\nfamily approval were now found through her success in a male-dominated\\nworld. Consideration of another relationship never crossed her mind again.\\nInstead, Rosemary moved up the ranks with fierce determination, a high IQ, and\\na lot of hard work, until she was the first woman in her state to hold the high\\nlevel of management she did.\\n\\nUsed to telling people what to do, Rosemary enjoyed the power her\\nintimidating manner gave her. This behaviour then carried over to her treatment\\nof the carers. She was going through one after another, never happy with any of\\nthem, until I arrived. She liked me because I had a banking background, which\\nin her eyes exempted me from being a fool. This way of thinking was certainly\\nnot one I resonated with but I had nothing to prove anymore either way, so I\\nfigured she could judge me in whatever way made her happy. After all, she was\\nin her eighties and dying. Rosemary then insisted on keeping me as her primary\\ncarer.\\n\\nThe mornings were particularly bad with bossy moods and nastiness. Having a\\nstrong sense of my own self by now, I tolerated it to a point but knew there\\nwould be a limit. When her mood turned especially nasty and personal one day, I\\ngave Rosemary the ultimatum. Be kinder or I was out of there. To this she\\nscreamed for me to go, to get out of her house, saying even nastier things than\\n\\x0cbefore, while sitting on the side of her bed.\\n\\nWhile she was screaming at me, I just went and sat next to her. “Go then. Get\\nout,” she kept yelling, pointing to the door. I just sat there looking at her, sending\\nher loving kindness, waiting for her outburst to subside. Silence followed. We\\nboth sat there for another minute or so, saying nothing, but sitting close enough\\nto be leaning on each other. “Finished?” I asked, smiling gently.\\n\\n“For now,” she huffed. I nodded, saying nothing. Silence continued. Finally, I\\njust put my arm around her, kissed her on the cheek and went out the kitchen,\\nreturning a few minutes later with a pot of tea. Rosemary was still sitting in the\\nsame position, looking like a lost little girl.\\n\\nHelping her up off the bed, we moved across to the settee in her room. The tea\\nwas waiting on the table beside it. Rosemary sat, looking up at me smiling as I\\nplaced a lovely rug over her legs, then I sat myself down too. “I’m so scared and\\nlonely. Please don’t leave me,” she said. “I feel safe with you.”\\n\\n“I’m not going anywhere. It’s OK. As long as you treat me respectfully, I’m\\nhere for you,” I told her sincerely.\\n\\nRosemary smiled like a little girl in need of love. “Stay then please. I want you\\nto stay.” Nodding, I kissed her on the cheek again, which made her smile hugely.\\n\\nFrom this point, things turned better between us immediately. She spoke of her\\npast, which helped me to understand her more, and of how she had always\\npushed people away. Having known that pattern in myself for a long time, and\\nthe benefits of breaking free of it, I explained how it wasn’t too late to let people\\nin. Rosemary said she didn’t know how but she wanted to try and be nicer.\\n\\nHer illness was slow to take hold but there were definitely signs of it spreading\\ndaily, particularly with her increasing weakness. It was a slow change at first and\\nwhile I could see it, Rosemary was still in occasional denial. Making plans for\\nme to do her books, and get all of her investment portfolios in order, she would\\ntalk in detail about this and that. I just listened, knowing it would never happen.\\nRosemary explained how she was going to spend a few hours with me to get\\nstarted on it all, when she had the energy. I had seen this before, where people\\ncontinued to make plans towards their future, while in the meantime their\\nstrength was disappearing more each day.\\n\\nShe also insisted on me making her appointments around town, ensuring I\\nmade the calls from her bedroom phone, where she could listen to every word I\\nsaid and butt in constantly, controlling the whole conversation. I’d then have to\\nreschedule them, not cancel them, one at a time. There was no denying\\nRosemary had a controlling personality. While I was happy to do certain\\n\\x0cunnecessary things for her, I refused outright at other times; like being unwilling\\nto waste my time and energy looking for things we had already looked for in\\nevery single inch of the home.\\n\\nEach day saw her emotional walls breaking down more and our closeness\\nincreasing. Rosemary’s relatives lived away, though did telephone regularly.\\nQuite a few friends were frequent visitors, as were former business associates.\\nMostly though, it was a pretty quiet home with a lovely garden we would enjoy\\ntogether.\\n\\nWhile watching me from her wheelchair nearby as I put some linen away one\\nafternoon, Rosemary told me to stop humming. “I hate that you’re happy all the\\ntime and always humming,” she declared miserably. I finished what I was doing,\\nclosed the linen cupboard door, turned around and looked at her with\\namusement. “Well, it’s true. You’re always humming and you’re always happy. I\\nwish you’d just be miserable sometimes.”\\n\\nThis was such a typical viewpoint from Rosemary that I wasn’t surprised by it\\nat all. I wasn’t always happy, but when I was it gave her something to moan\\nabout. Instead of responding verbally though, I just looked at her, then did a\\npirouette, poked my tongue out at her, and left the room laughing. She loved me\\nfor this, as when I came back into the room shortly after, she was smiling with\\nmischief and acceptance. Never did she condemn my positive moods again in\\nsuch a way.\\n\\n“Why are you happy?” Rosemary asked one morning soon after. “I mean, not\\njust today, but in general. Why are you happy?” I smiled at the question,\\nthinking how far I had come in myself to even be asked such a question.\\nConsidering what I had been going through in my own life while caring for\\nRosemary, it was a rather poignant question.\\n\\n“Because happiness is a choice Rosemary and one I try to make every day.\\nSome days I can’t. Like you, I’ve had a hard life too, in different ways but still\\nhard. But rather than dwelling on what’s wrong and how hard I’ve done it, I am\\ntrying to find the blessings in each day and appreciating the moment I am in, as\\nmuch as I can,” I told her honestly. “We have the freedom to choose what we\\nfocus on. I try to choose the positive stuff, like getting to know you, like doing\\nwork I love, not being under pressure to reach sales targets, and appreciating my\\nhealth and every day of being alive.” Rosemary smiled, looking at me intensely\\nas she absorbed my words.\\n\\nWhat she didn’t know though, was that while I was caring for her I had also\\nbeen dealing with illness of my own. Some time prior, I had had a minor\\n\\x0coperation. When the specialist called me with the results, he told me they were\\nopen to doubt and a larger operation had to be done immediately. I told him I\\nwould think about it.\\n\\n“There is nothing to think about,“ he had stated adamantly, “you must have\\nthis operation or you could be dead in a year.” Again, I told him I would think\\nabout it. I had already done some big learning through my body, which isn’t\\nsurprising since the body is where our past is stored. All of our pain and joy\\nmanifests within the body in one way or another. Having managed to relieve\\nmyself of smaller ailments previously, by healing various painful emotions, I\\ndecided a huge gift of healing was now on offer to me. So I would approach my\\nillness from that perspective.\\n\\nHaving enough of my own fear to deal with though, I was only able to share\\nthe situation with one or two people. It was going to take all of my strength to\\nget through it and to stay focused on what I wanted, which was health. So I\\ncouldn’t risk taking on other people’s opinions or fears. These may have been\\nintended with love, but there was not one inch of space for anyone else’s fear on\\nthis healing journey. Having the courage to express myself emotionally, to\\nrelease things from some very deep levels, became even more important and\\nthings certainly turned dark for a while. A lot of past stuff surfaced from the\\ndepths.\\n\\nAt one stage, it became so difficult and emotionally painful I ended up\\nwelcoming the thought of dying, and asked the illness to take me away. When I\\nhad to seriously contemplate my whole life and accept that despite my efforts, I\\nmay actually pass on from this illness and not live through to an old age, I\\nreached a point where an amazing peace was found. Realising I had already\\nlived an incredible life and I’d had the courage to honour my own heart and\\ncalling, allowed me to look my death in the face and accept either outcome. The\\npeace that followed this acceptance was beautiful.\\n\\nWhile continuing with my usual meditation practice though, I also worked\\nthrough various healing books and visualisation techniques, in addition to\\nreleasing the emotions that wanted out. Various shifts started to occur within me.\\nEventually, I reached a stage where I felt the worst was behind me, and that I\\nwas on the road to wellness.\\n\\nA lovely house-sit was offered in a rambling little cottage, covered in vines\\nand hidden away behind a high fence. It was in a fairly affluent suburb, but was\\nalmost invisible and I loved it. Soaking in a bath had always been a bit of a\\nlifesaver for me too, and this house had an enormous one. Being in such a\\n\\x0ccongenial environment, I decided to do a juice fast, as I had numerous times\\nbefore, and a couple of days of silence and meditation.\\n\\nMy body had always been a great indicator of where my emotions had been. If\\na minor ailment would present itself, I could recognise where my thoughts or\\nactivities had been in the days or weeks leading up to this. As a result, over time\\nI had come to enjoy a very clear and honest communication channel from my\\nbody, always now listening to what it was saying and doing my best to adhere to\\nmethods of improvement. Often clients or friends would admit to knowing there\\nwas something wrong in their body, long before they did anything about it. But\\nhaving seen the lack of quality that life offers once health is gone, I had learned\\nto act on any signs from my body as soon and as best as I could. Health offers\\namazing freedom that once gone, is often gone forever.\\n\\nOne of the meditations I did while in the cottage was guidance from a book I\\nhad recently bought. There were many stages leading up to this point though,\\nand much work had already been done. This particular book was looking at the\\nintelligence of our cells, how they worked together, and offered guidance in\\nasking them to eradicate the illness from the body. It was healing at a cell level.\\nSo mid-morning, I sat myself down on my meditation cushion and slipped into a\\ndeep, peaceful place within. Following through with the visualisations and\\nrequests, I asked my cells to free me from the last of the illness, if by now any of\\nit remained in me.\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, I was running to the toilet and projectile vomiting. It\\ncame from the deepest parts of my body and I continued to vomit for ages, until\\nI felt that there was absolutely nothing left inside of me. Sitting on the floor\\ntotally drained, leaning against the bath, I waited in a daze in case there was\\nmore. It came, and then even more came, until eventually, it all ceased. I stood\\nup using the bath as support, due to exhaustion from my efforts. My stomach\\nwas also aching from the repeated heaving. Walking back slowly to the\\nmeditation room, feeling very shifted, I lay down on the soft carpet, pulled a big\\nblanket over me, curled up into a foetal position and slept for six hours straight.\\n\\nThe late afternoon light shone into the room and the beginnings of the evening\\nchill woke me gently. Lying there still snug under the blanket, looking at the\\nbeautiful light shining in, I felt like I was in a new life. Sending out a prayer of\\ngratitude for the guidance and courage that had brought me to this point of\\nhealing, I smiled to myself. My body was still a littke weak from the day’s\\nevents. But as I became more mobile, getting up and on with the evening,\\neuphoria washed through me. Preparing a gentle meal after the fast, my face\\n\\x0cached in happiness. It was over.\\n\\nMy body had healed and no sign of the illness has resurfaced in the years\\nsince. While I am very respectful of everyone choosing their own method of\\nhealing, whether that is through surgical operations, natural therapies, eastern\\ntraditions, or western pharmaceuticals, I had chosen the right method for myself.\\nIt had taken everything I had ever learned to get myself through this time, but I\\nhad done it.\\n\\nIt never felt appropriate to share this story with my clients though, as the\\nmethods I used took almost four decades of preparation through my own life\\nexperiences, and many months of healing. It would not have been kind to offer\\nfalse hope to them. By the time I knew all of these people, they were already too\\nclose to the very end of the illness and their life.\\n\\nThrough this experience, I appreciated the gift of my life much more and\\nfound choosing happiness was a daily thing, a new habit to integrate into my\\nthinking. There were days when I couldn’t be happy, but I think that accepting\\nthis leads to a more peaceful existence anyway. It allows for acceptance of the\\nharder days, knowing they bring gifts of their own and will pass, with happiness\\nwaiting again on the other side. Consciously choosing to focus on happiness and\\nblessings when I could though was certainly creating positive changes within\\nme.\\n\\nSo when Rosemary asked me why I was always humming and happy, it was\\nbecause I had just experienced a self-made miracle and was feeling very\\nempowered and blessed.\\n\\nRosemary wanted to be happy, she said to me later that day, but didn’t know\\nhow. “Well, just pretend to be, for half an hour. Maybe you’ll enjoy it enough to\\nactually be happy. The physical act of smiling changes your emotions anyway\\nRosemary. So I dare you to not frown, complain, or say anything negative for\\nhalf an hour. Instead, say nice stuff, focus on the garden if you must, but\\nremember to smile,” I directed her. Reminding Rosemary that I didn’t know her\\nin the past, it allowed her to be whoever she wanted to be right now. Sometimes\\nhappiness takes a conscious effort.\\n\\n“T don’t think I ever felt like I deserved to be happy, you know. My marriage\\nbreakup tarnished the family name and reputation. How do I be happy?” she\\nasked with sincerity that broke my heart.\\n\\n“You allow yourself to be. You are a beautiful woman and you deserve to\\nknow happiness. Allow yourself and choose to be.” Rosemary’s hindrances were\\nones that I myself had known too well in the past. So reminding her that her\\n\\x0cfamily’s opinion or reputation could only rob her of happiness if she allowed it\\nto, I lightened the mood with some humour, assisting happiness to flow.\\n\\nAlthough a little hesitant at first, Rosemary began to give herself permission to\\nbe happy, letting her guard down more each day, sharing a smile often, which\\neventually turned into occasional laughter. Whenever one of her old moods\\nwould strike, where she would rudely order me to do something, I would just\\nlaugh and say, “I don’t think so!” Instead of becoming even ruder, she would\\nlaugh then ask in a kinder manner, to which I would happily oblige with no fuss.\\n\\nEach day her health faded though and was now at the point where she was\\nnoticing it too. While continuing to speak about how she was going to show me\\nwhat to do with her books, she no longer looked so puzzled when I didn’t join in\\nwith encouraging conversation about it. Rosemary’s time out of bed was also\\nbecoming less and less. She had to accept being washed in bed now, as it was too\\nmuch of a risk on her health and my back to try moving her into the shower.\\n\\nIf I spent too much time out in the rest of the house doing things, she would\\ncall me back in for company. As Rosemary was now in a hospital bed in her\\nbedroom, her own bed was vacant beside her. The hospital bed was necessary as\\nshe was no longer able to assist with any transfers out of bed. The hydraulics of\\nthe hospital bed also allowed her to sit up without breaking my back, or the night\\ncarer’s back. So when there were no other duties to do, other than to keep her\\ncompany, I took to lying on her old bed while we talked. Rosemary was most\\ncomfortable resting on her side, so this allowed her less effort and was rather\\nsnug for me too.\\n\\nBefore long we fell into the habit of having an afternoon nap each. Her street\\nwas peaceful at that time of day and I was right there if she needed anything. So\\nI slept well too, getting myself all snuggly under the blankets. We would wake\\nand share any dreams we’d had and continue lying there talking to each other\\nuntil I had to get up and attend to things. They were special, tender times for us\\nboth.\\n\\nOne afternoon, while we were lying down talking, Rosemary asked me what\\ndeath is like, the actually dying part. Other clients had asked this too. I guess it is\\njust like when people ask others of their experience in various things, like\\npregnant women ask other women what childbirth is like. Or people who have\\ntravelled will ask other travellers what a particular country is like. But in this\\ncase, a dying person cannot ask someone who has died what it is like, as they are\\nrarely around anymore to tell them. So they often asked me of my opinions and\\nof what I had experienced. With honesty, I always told them about Stella going\\n\\x0cout smiling. I also shared how all of the transitions I had witnessed were over in\\na short time. Stella’s story always brought them peace, just as it had for me in\\nbeing there.\\n\\nIn modern society, such little emphasis is put on spiritual and emotional\\nwellbeing in the treatment of dying people, or in the treatment of anyone who is\\nill. Unless dying people are blessed to be in a centre that embraces these aspects\\nof life, they are usually left to wonder about these things. This is very frightening\\nfor them, as well as isolating. There is an enormous gap between treating\\nphysical health and even acknowledging the link of spiritual or emotional health\\nin modern society. By uniting these needs and treating all aspects of someone’s\\njourney, the dying person would be able to reconcile a great deal more within\\nthem self prior to their last weeks or days.\\n\\nThis area is one of the obvious failings we have by hiding death from society’s\\neyes. Dying people have so many questions, things that could have been asked\\nmuch earlier in their life had they considered that they would one day die, as we\\nall will. If asked earlier, these questions about matters much deeper would allow\\npeople to find their answers and their own peace sooner. They would then not\\nhave to live in denial about their approaching death out of pure fear and terror, as\\nwas often the case.\\n\\nIt came a time though, when Rosemary could no longer deny her approaching\\ndeath. There were times when she wanted to be alone, ‘much to contemplate,’\\nshe would say.\\n\\nAs I came back into her room early one evening she declared, “I wish I’d let\\nmyself be happier. What a miserable person I have been. I just didn’t think I\\ndeserved to be. But I do. I know that now. Laughing with you this morning I\\nrealised that there was no need at all to feel guilty for being happy”. Sitting\\ndown on the side of her bed, I listened as she went on.\\n\\n“Tt really is our own choice, isn’t it? We can stop ourselves from being happy\\nbecause we think we don’t deserve it, or because we allow the opinions of others\\nto become a part of who we are. But it is not who we are, is it? We can be\\nwhoever we allow ourselves to be. My God, why didn’t I work this out sooner?\\nWhat a waste!”\\n\\nLovingly, I smiled at her. “Well, I’ve been in that place too Rosemary. But\\nbeing gentle and compassionate is a healthier way to treat yourself. At any rate,\\nyou’ve worked it out now, by allowing at least some happiness into your life\\nrecently. We’ve had some beautiful times.” Recalling things we had laughed at,\\nRosemary then agreed chuckling, and found herself in a happy mood again.\\n\\x0c“T am starting to like who I am these days Bronnie, this lighter side of me.”\\nSmiling, I said I liked this side of her too. “Oh, wasn’t I a tyrant?” she chuckled,\\nthinking back to our first weeks together.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all laughter between us though. There were moments shared that\\nwere sad and tender too, when we held hands and cried together, knowing what\\nawaited her. At least Rosemary had experienced some happiness in her final\\nmonths though. She had such a beautiful smile. I can still see it.\\n\\nOn her last afternoon, pneumonia had taken over and her throat was very thick\\nwith mucus. A few relatives had arrived by now too, as well as a couple of\\nlovely friends. While her departure was not entirely the smoothest I’d seen, it\\nwas incredibly brief. The dear woman had moved on elsewhere.\\n\\nDue that afternoon was the community nurse, who arrived about ten minutes\\nlater. While Rosemary’s relatives and friends were out chatting in the kitchen,\\nthe nurse and I cleaned her, and then dressed her in a fresh nightdress. The nurse\\nwas one who hadn’t met Rosemary and as we were attending to her body, she\\nasked me what she had been like as a person.\\n\\nLooking at the body of my lovely friend and at the peaceful face that now lay\\nsleeping forever, I smiled. Memories of our afternoons lying in accompanying\\nbeds came flooding back. Images of Rosemary laughing, giving me cheek, also\\nflashed by.\\n\\n“She was happy,” I replied truthfully. “Yes. She was a happy woman.”\\n\\x0cHAPPINESS IS NOW\\neter\\n\\nOf all of my clients, Cath was by far the philosopher of them all. She had an\\nopinion on everything. But it wasn’t blind opinion, rather very informed. As a\\nlover of knowledge and philosophy, she had absorbed a huge amount of learning\\nin her fifty-one years. Cath also still lived in the house she was born in. “My\\nmother was born and died here. I am going to do the same,” she stated with\\ndetermination.\\n\\nShe was also a lover of baths, so the best conversations we had in our first\\ncouple of months together were usually with her in the bath and me sitting on a\\nstool beside it. With my own love and appreciation of a good soak, I was\\ndetermined to help Cath use her tub for as long as possible. After a while though,\\nshe had grown weaker and wasn’t going to be strong enough to get in or out\\nanymore, even with my assistance. The risk of a fall was also too high.\\n\\nWhen she knew it was to be her last ever soak in the bath, Cath started to cry,\\nher tears falling into the water surrounding her. “It’s all going. It’s the bath now,”\\nshe cried. “Then it will be my walking. Then I won’t even be able to stand, then\\nme, myself, gone. It’s all going. My life is winding down.” Her crying soon\\nbecame sobbing, raw and uninhibited. As much as my heart felt for her, and my\\nown tears were very near the surface, it was also good to see someone able to\\nrelease their emotions with such honesty.\\n\\nFrom the depths of her soul, Cath cried a river of tears. When it seemed there\\nwas nothing left to come out, she sat in the bath quietly, exhausted from her\\nsobbing, staring at the water or drawing patterns on the surface. Then it would\\nstart again, each sob coming from a place even deeper and more primal than\\nbefore. She cried for every sad memory ever held within her, for all of the people\\nshe had lost, for all of those she would lose by going. But especially, Cath cried\\nfor herself.\\n\\nAny time I would attempt to leave, to give her some privacy, she would shake\\nher head and ask me to stay. So I sat on the stool, sending her love, saying\\nnothing, just being there while she sobbed. It was heartbreaking but healthy at\\nthe same time, knowing she was letting go from such a deep place.\\n\\nWhen another half an hour had passed and the water was losing its heat, I\\n\\x0coffered to top it up with some more. Cath shook her head. “No, it’s OK. It’s\\ntime,” and with that, pulled the plug and looked to me for assistance in getting\\nout. Taking her in her wheelchair out into the sun soon after, wrapped in her pale\\nblue dressing gown and fiery red slippers, she seemed peaceful.\\n\\n“Listen to the bird,” she smiled. We both sat quietly, delighting in its song,\\nsmiling even more when we heard its mate reply from a tree further up the street.\\n“Every day is a gift now, you know. Every day was always a gift but it’s only\\nnow I have slowed down enough, I am truly seeing the huge amount of beauty\\neach day offers to us. We can take so much for granted. Listen.” Different songs\\nrang out from a few nearby trees.\\n\\nCath said how she had come to see what a powerful force gratitude is. It is too\\neasy to always want more from life, she said, and that’s fine to a degree, since\\nexpanding who we are is a part of dreaming and growing. But as we will never\\nhave everything we want and will always be growing, appreciating what we\\nalready have along the way is the most important thing. Life goes so fast, she\\nstated, whether you live until your twenties, forties, or eighties. She was right.\\nEvery day in itself is a gift and a blessing. It is all we ever have anyway, the\\nmoment we are in.\\n\\nFor the past twenty years I had kept a gratitude journal, where I wrote a few\\nthings down at the end of the day for which I was grateful. Often there were lots\\nof things to be grateful for. But occasionally, through the darkest times, I\\nstruggled to come up with any. Emotional exhaustion had worn me out to such a\\npoint that even finding blessings was an effort. Yet I always persisted. Even then\\nI would manage to come up with things I was grateful for, like clean water,\\nsomewhere to sleep, food in my belly, a smile from a stranger, or a bird singing.\\n\\nBut, as I explained to Cath, while I was appreciating things at the end of the\\nnight when I was writing them down, it had still taken some training to get into\\nthe habit of always appreciating things as they were happening as well,\\nparticularly intricate things. At the very least, it was a new habit to create by\\nsaying a silent prayer of thanks at the very time each of the gifts was given.\\n\\nNature had always received thanks in the moment, definitely. An example I\\ngave was if a soft breeze kissed my face, I was grateful for being healthy enough\\nto be outside to feel it. But I wanted to be more grateful for other things along\\nthe way too. Although writing in the journal had certainly opened me up to a\\nmuch better level of gratitude, it was the success of living more presently that\\nhad finally brought gratitude into my every day living situations. There is\\nsomething to say thank you for every hour, I decided, and that was how my habit\\n\\x0cwas formed.\\n\\n“Then I’m sure you receive many blessings, if you are grateful along the\\nway?” Cath enquired.\\n\\n“When I allow it Cath, when I remember my own worth and let it flow, yes.\\nI’ve definitely had some great blessings in my life. Sometimes I just have to get\\nout of my own way first. Like everyone, blessings come to me more when I am\\nin a place of gratitude and flow.”\\n\\nCath laughed at my theory and agreed. “Yes, it wants to flow to us. But\\nwithout gratitude and allowing it through, we block it I think. Most people just\\ndon’t realise how good they have it. I didn’t for a long time either. But thankfully\\nI had started working it out before this illness struck, so I was able to live from a\\nbetter place in myself then.”\\n\\nAfter some lovely time in the sun, Cath needed her lunch and a rest. Lunch\\nwas ice cream and stewed fruit. That was all she could handle eating now.\\nEverything else took too much effort to chew, she told me, and tasted lifeless.\\nAfterwards, I lifted her legs up onto the bed and moved her into a comfortable\\nposition, then drew the curtains closed. Her painkillers had recently been\\nincreased which left her more comfortable, but exhausted. So in no time, she was\\nin a deep sleep.\\n\\nIn the early evening, Cath’s ex-girlfriend dropped by to say hello. There were\\nno hard feelings between them. They had remained good friends after their\\nbreakup more than a decade ago. It was a kind and respectful friendship. Other\\nvisitors were regular too, Cath’s older brother and his wife and children, and her\\nyounger brother. Some neighbours dropped in daily, and friends and work\\ncolleagues also came by every chance they could. She was a well-loved woman.\\n\\nFrom the various stories shared by her visitors, Cath had been very driven in\\nher work but usually with positive energy for everyone. Now, as with any dying\\npeople, she loved her visitors to bring her up to date on their lives and what was\\nhappening in the world outside her fence. When dying people can no longer live\\nin that world themselves, they seem to savour every morsel of news from\\noutside. Often friends and relatives don’t know what to say. Hearing about life\\noutside keeps a person in the swing of things and this is positive for them, not\\nnegative.\\n\\nSuch was definitely the case for Cath. She wanted to hear about happy things\\nas much she could. It was hard for the visitors though, as they were often\\nheartbroken at the impending loss of someone they loved. Because of our easy\\nconnection I was able to speak openly with Cath about anything. So at the\\n\\x0crequest of her friend Sue, I touched on the emotions of her visitors one day.\\n\\nSue was battling every day to stay positive for her friend, when all she wanted\\nto do was to sob her eyes out every time she visited. Sue told me how she would\\nsit in her car outside, psyching herself into being strong and happy before each\\nvisit. Then she’d sit out there again afterwards, crying her heart out. “I sort of\\nsee that,” Cath admitted later. “I just don’t know if I can deal with Sue’s sadness\\non top of my own. I can’t carry that too.”\\n\\n“But you don’t have to carry it,” I said. “Just allow her to express herself\\nhonestly by not changing the subject when she shares her feelings. She needs to\\nsay stuff and all you need to do is allow her to. You don’t have to carry it as well.\\nShe’s not asking you to do that. She just needs to tell you how much she loves\\nyou and she can’t do it without crying or without you letting her.”\\n\\nCath understood where I was coming from and said she felt slack for creating\\nso much sadness for everyone. It almost embarrassed her. “Gosh Cath, at this\\ntime in your life, does pride really matter?” I asked directly, but kindly. She\\nlaughed in reply. “Just bring it out into the open and allow others to tell you how\\nmuch they love you,” I said.\\n\\nCath smiled at me and sat silent for a moment before responding. “Some time\\nago, when I was realising the seriousness of my disease, I learned to accept my\\nfeelings and not reject them. They come up and I allow them to now. That’s how\\nI was so free sobbing in front of you that day in the bath. I’ve learned to accept\\nmy feelings as what they are in the moment, without rejecting them by trying to\\nblock them out. They are really just a bi-product of my thoughts and mind\\nanyway. I know it is possible to create new feelings by focusing on better things.\\nBut those within me already are a part of the current me, and are best released,\\nnot carried forward. Yet here I am, not respecting the feelings of others by\\nrejecting and blocking their honest expression.” Cath shook her head at herself\\nand sighed. Then after a moment’s thought, she looked at me smiling and said, “I\\nguess it is time for me to be brave and let their tears flow too”.\\n\\nNodding in agreement, I suggested that things could still possibly be light on\\noccasions following. But the current build-up of emotions from her friends and\\nrelatives needed to be shared. They loved her and they needed to be able to say\\nand show this, even if it meant through tears sometimes.\\n\\nSoon after, there were many tearful conversations between Cath and her\\nvisitors, but the love that flowed was inspiring. Hearts were opened and though\\nthey were breaking in some ways, they were healing too, through the expression\\nof love now flowing.\\n\\x0cOn one particularly tearful day, the last friend had just left. She was laughing\\nthrough tears of both sadness and joy as her and Cath cracked jokes with each\\nother until she was out of sight. When she was gone, Cath looked at me with\\nlove. “Yes, it is important to let feelings come out, to accept them. And it is\\nhealthy for my friends too,” she said. “These will also be better memories for\\nthem. They won’t be blocked by carrying things they don’t need to.”\\n\\nEnjoying her analysis, I nodded in understanding. In my darker days, I’d\\nfinally been able to separate myself from my feelings, realising they were just an\\nemotional expression of my pain, or joy, and were not who I truly was. Like\\neveryone, I carried the wisdom of my soul within me. But to know my true self,\\nthat divine wisdom residing within, I had to allow my feelings out. If not, they\\nwould always block me from reaching the potential of who I was truly here to\\nbe. So I loved to hear of Cath coming to similar conclusions, but expressing it in\\nher own words.\\n\\nAlready being a thin build, it took very little time for her to start looking ill as\\nthe weight continued to fall off. “My time is winding up. I can’t ignore the signs,\\nthat’s for sure,” she declared one morning, while sitting on the commode. So\\nmany conversations with clients happened as they sat doing their moming\\nbusiness on the portable toilet, while I sat nearby. The fact that they were having\\na bowel movement never really came into it. It was just a part of the routine and\\nthere was no point in letting such business get in the way of a good yarn. As I\\nhelped Cath back to bed after, I agreed that indeed, the signs were pointing to her\\ntime winding up.\\n\\nOnce settled back into bed, she said, “I am not sorry for how I have lived,\\nbecause I have learned through most of what I have done. But if I was to do\\nanything differently, given the chance to again, I would have allowed more\\nhappiness in”. I was a little puzzled to hear these words from her. By now I had\\nheard them from other clients of course, but Cath appeared as a happy person.\\nWell, as happy as one can be when you are dying and feeling absolutely awful in\\nyour body in the process. So I questioned her on this.\\n\\nExplaining that she had loved her work, she then told me of how she had put\\ntoo much emphasis on the results. Cath had worked on projects for troubled\\nyouths and believed that making a contribution was vital for a satisfying life.\\n“We all have talents to share, every single one of us. It doesn’t matter what your\\njob is. What matters is that you are trying to make a conscious contribution,\\nhoping to create a better world,” Cath elaborated. “The only way things are\\ngoing to improve is for us all to realise the inter-connectedness we share.\\n\\x0cNothing good can be done alone. If only we could learn to work together for the\\ngood of all, instead of against each other in competition and fear.”\\n\\nDespite being exhausted and spending her time now mostly confined to bed,\\nCath still had a lot to say. The philosopher would be the last part of her to go, I\\nsuspected (which suited me just fine). I rubbed cream into her arms and hands as\\nshe went on. “We all have a positive contribution to make. I’ve made mine. But\\nwhile I was searching for my purpose in life, I forgot to enjoy myself along the\\nway. It was all about the result of finding what I was looking for. Then when I\\ndid find work I loved, work I could do with the heartfelt intention of\\ncontributing, I was still results-based.”\\n\\nThis was something I had seen often. They were also familiar words from\\nother clients. While working towards goals, the present moment is too often\\nneglected along the way. This is what Cath was talking about. Her happiness was\\nbased on the end result, and was not enjoyed during the process of getting there.\\nI commented that none of us were immune from doing that at times, myself\\nincluded.\\n\\nShe continued. “Yes, but this way, I have robbed myself of potential\\nhappiness. That’s what I mean when I say I would do it differently. It is\\nimportant, sure, to work toward finding your purpose and contributing to the\\nworld, in any capacity. But depending on the end result for your happiness is not\\nthe way to do it. Gratitude for every day along the way is the key to\\nacknowledging and enjoying happiness now. Not when the results come in or\\nwhen you retire, or when this or that happens.” Cath sighed, exhausted from her\\nfervent outburst but with a need to be heard, as was so often the case.\\n\\nAfter listening and then sharing my understanding of her thoughts, I adjusted\\nher blankets and headed out to the kitchen to make us some tea. Cutting some\\nfresh lemongrass from the garden, I thought about Cath’s words. Very similar\\nwords from other dying people came to mind too. As a bird sang and the scent of\\nlemongrass, now in the teapot, wafted through the kitchen, it was very easy to\\nfeel completely present and grateful.\\n\\nWanting to relax and listen now, Cath asked me where I lived. Laughing a\\nlittle, I explained how this was the first question any of my friends asked me\\nwhenever they called. “Where are you these days?” were words my ears knew\\nwell. So I told Cath all about my earlier years of drifting, followed by the recent\\nyears of house-sitting, and how recently, my energy for such a transient\\nexistence was beginning to wane. House-sits were not as forthcoming or\\nconsistent for me in Melbourne as they had been in Sydney. Not knowing where\\n\\x0cI’d be living next was starting to leave me weary, as was the whole moving\\nprocess. Something I had once thrived on and loved was now beginning to\\nexhaust me.\\n\\nAfter staying with a few friends in between house-sits, I had recently rented\\nthe spare room of a house belonging to a woman I knew a little. Although I was\\nhugely grateful for her kindness and to not be moving every few weeks, it was\\nstill very much her domain. So it never truly felt like home and was not ideal for\\nthe long-term.\\n\\nIt was all meant to be though as the situation served to intensify the longing\\nfor my own space again. It had been almost a decade since I’d had my own\\nkitchen and home space. The desire for this continued to increase daily. Cath\\nsaid how she couldn’t even imagine such a life when she had lived in the same\\nhouse for fifty-one years. I said I couldn’t imagine her life either and that even\\nthough I was starting to long for my own space again, a part of me would always\\nlove to roam a little. Now though, I was thinking in terms of having a settled\\nbase and travelling from there, rather than moving my whole home base every\\ntime itchy feet kicked in.\\n\\nThe years of roaming, which had been a part of me for my whole adult life\\nwere a big part of who I used to be. But changes were happening within me and I\\nno longer had the desire or energy to maintain the life I had before. All I really\\nwanted was my own kitchen again and the privacy to be in my own space.\\n\\nAgreeing that change is a guaranteed part of life, Cath laughed and said I\\nhelped the law of averages out by changing my life so often. Replying that\\npeople like me were needed to balance out people like her who lived in the same\\nhouse for half a century, we both giggled. Our lives were so different yet we\\nshared a very strong connection. It was due to our shared love of philosophy.\\n\\nWanting to know how I ended up in this field of palliative care, Cath was\\nastonished when I spoke of all of my years in the banking industry. “Oh, I cannot\\nimagine it at all,” she said surprised.\\n\\n“Me either, thank goodness,” I laughed. It amazed me thinking back to then,\\njust how much can be fit into one lifetime, and how it was difficult to even\\nimagine myself being in that world, let alone for so long. “Stockings, high heels,\\nand corporate uniforms just never sat right for me Cath, nor did the structured\\nlife.”\\n\\n“I’m not surprised, considering the life you have chosen since,” she chuckled,\\nbefore turning more serious and asking how long I was going to do this work for\\nand if I had any other work aspirations. There was no point holding back. I had\\n\\x0calready learned the importance of honesty and it felt marvellous to be able to talk\\nso freely on this topic. Many things had been on my mind in this regard recently,\\nand talking them out with Cath gave me some clarity.\\n\\nSomewhere along the way in the last twelve months or so, the idea of teaching\\nsongwriting in a jail had come to mind. The prison system was something I\\nknew nothing about, yet the idea had stuck with me. Over this time the seed had\\ncontinued to grow slowly. I had recently made some contact with a great woman\\nwho had taken me under her wing, guiding me through the possibilities of\\nfinding funding.\\n\\n“Yes, get back to the living Bronnie. It is beautiful work you do here and\\nobviously a part of your purpose this time around. But it must wear you down\\nsometimes,” Cath insisted. Telling her how it had now been almost eight years\\nsince I first began working in this field, I felt something shift within, an\\nacknowledgment that I was indeed close to hitting the wall if I continued. I was\\nstarting to burn out.\\n\\nSeeing people find their peace and being a witness to their growth, in the\\nsunset of their life, was an incredible honour. It brought me many, many rewards\\nof satisfaction and fulfillment. There was no denying that I had loved this work\\nand still did. But I also wanted to work where there might perhaps be a little bit\\nof hope, around people who had a chance to grow and change their lives\\nconsiderably before they were dying. The desire for working entirely in a\\ncreative field had also been building, as had the hope of being able to work more\\nfrom home, once I did find my own space to live in again.\\n\\nHearing myself speaking all of these thoughts out loud to Cath gave tangible\\nenergy to the process. Before I knew it, ideas about teaching in a jail were\\noccupying my thoughts more and more. My time in care work was coming to an\\nend. It needed to. I’d given almost all I could to it.\\n\\nNot long before passing on, Cath got a second wind and appeared to be getting\\nbetter for a couple of days. I’d seen this before and telephoned all of her regular\\nvisitors to come and spend some brief time with her, as she was about to turn\\nonto the final, downward slope. Some of them questioned me after their visit, as\\nshe looked so great and her energy had improved. It seems to be a blessing we\\nare occasionally given after someone has been ill for so long. It helps us to\\nremember them with a bit of their old spark, before the illness had taken over.\\nLaughter rang out from Cath’s room for two days while she cracked witty jokes\\nand enjoyed beautiful clarity with friends and family.\\n\\nWhen I arrived the following day though, I was looking at a dying woman,\\n\\x0chardly able to even respond to me verbally. Cath was limp with no strength at all\\nand remained this way for another three days. She mostly slept, but when she\\nwas awake she smiled at me, as I changed her pads and washed her. Even the\\nluxury of urinating on a commode was now in the past.\\n\\nFriends returned and left solemnly, knowing they had just said their final\\ngoodbye to their dear Cath. At the end of the third day, it was obvious she would\\nnot make it through the night. So when my shift was finished, I stayed on there\\nwith Cath’s brother and sister-in-law. The night carer had never seen a dead body\\nand was hugely relieved I was staying. Thinking back to when I had been in that\\nposition all of those years ago myself, I saw how far I had come. Little did I\\nknow just how many beautiful people I would meet, in such a personal way, nor\\nthe unforeseeable blessings of learning that would flow to me.\\n\\nCath’s painkillers had been given to her intravenously for the last few days, as\\nshe could no longer swallow solid tablets. The palliative care nurse arrived in the\\nevening to dispense some more. Cath was no longer awake or coherent. “This\\nwill be the last,” she told Cath’s brother and me. “She won’t make it through the\\nnight anyway.” We thanked her gently and I walked her out. “She’ll be gone\\nwithin the hour,” the nurse told me as I said goodbye at the gate. There was so\\nmuch joy and sadness in this role: Sadness in saying goodbye and letting go.\\nHappiness for the end of their suffering and for the love we shared. It was\\nbittersweet and some tears slowly fell.\\n\\nCath didn’t wait another hour. She passed away as I was walking back to her\\nroom. Her breathing had simply slowed down and then stopped. Looking at her\\nlying there, that beautiful spirit now elsewhere, I smiled through my tears, still\\nhearing her voice in my head. “Don’t hang around with dying people forever, let\\nsome joy back in,” she had said to me in a dying whisper the previous morning.\\n\\nMy tears burst forth and I let them flow, as I stood beside her bed. “Happy\\ntravels my friend,” I said silently from my heart. Her brother and sister-in-law\\ncame around to the side of the bed, each giving me a loving hug, through their\\nown tears. Formalities were then to be attended, which her family wanted to do.\\nSo I looked back at Cath’s body one last time, a body I had washed and\\nmassaged so many times. But Cath wasn’t in there anymore. Her spirit had\\nmoved on. She was still in my heart though and smiling softly, I said my final\\ngoodbyes to her and her family. The night carer also said goodnight, before she\\nheaded off down the road. Then walking out of Cath’s home for the last time, the\\nstreetlights shining bright in the quiet suburban street, I pulled the gate closed\\nbehind me.\\n\\x0cThe world always felt surreal after I had experienced a passing. My senses\\nwere heightened and I felt like I was observing the world from somewhere else.\\nAs I walked up the stairs of the tram, I was hardly aware of others around me.\\nThe world went by outside as I sat thinking about Cath and the beautiful time we\\nhad shared.\\n\\nWhen the tram stopped at a red light, I watched laughing people walking into\\na restaurant. It was a balmy evening and everyone I saw coming and going was\\njovial. My tired, weary eyes smiled, viewing signs of such happiness. Sounds\\nfrom inside the tram then came to my ears, after having been zoned out for some\\ntime. All I heard from there too were happy conversations. It was just one of\\nthose nights, where happiness was in the air. Although there had been certainly\\nbeen sadness in my night, there was happiness too for having known Cath.\\n\\nThe sounds of laughter from others danced with me, bringing me happiness of\\nmy own. As the tram moved on again, I looked out the window and thought\\nabout the good hearts of people everywhere and of those who were in my view.\\nGratitude warmed my own heart, and I couldn’t help but smile.\\n\\nI wasn’t thinking of the past or the future. Happiness is now. And that is where\\nI was.\\n\\x0cA MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE\\neter\\n\\nOne of my final clients and one who had a beautiful and lasting impression on\\nme was a dear man who was in a nursing home. It was still with reluctance that I\\never took any of these shifts. They always brought me down the moment I\\nwalked through the door, leaving me feeling heartbroken from seeing the\\nsituations of these people. So it was only when there was absolutely no work on\\nthe horizon with private home clients that I accepted the work. In this case, I was\\nvery glad I did.\\n\\nLenny was already close to passing when we met. His daughter had employed\\nme as an extra, knowing that regular staff members at the nursing home were all\\ntoo busy to give him the care she wanted him to have. He slept much of the day,\\naccepting cups of tea but declining all food. When he awoke, he would pat the\\nside of the bed for me to sit close to him, as he didn’t have the energy to speak\\nloudly. “It has been a good life,” he would say regularly. “Yes, a good life.”\\n\\nThis was certainly a matter of perspective and reinforced how happiness is\\nbased on choice far more than circumstances. Lenny’s life had not been easy at\\nall. Both of his parents had died before he was fourteen, his siblings either dying\\nor dispersing over the following years until he had lost contact with them all. He\\nmet Rita, the love of his life, when he was twenty-two and married her in a\\nwhirlwind, as he put it.\\n\\nFour children came from the marriage. Their oldest son had died in the\\nVietnam War, something he still shook his head about. Lenny spoke fiercely of\\nwar and the insanity of it. He said he would never understand how anyone could\\npossibly think that war would ever bring lasting peace. His thoughts about the\\nmadness and sadness of the current world situation were shared. I soon valued\\nthis lovely man’s intelligence and philosophies.\\n\\nStaff members would drop by now and then offering food, which he always\\ndeclined with a smile and a shake of his head, resting against the pillow. The\\nbusy activity in the halls seemed to fade away after a while, as if we were in our\\nown dimension, totally unaffected by the noise nearby.\\n\\nTheir eldest daughter had married a Canadian man and moved there. She died\\nsix months later, after losing control of her car in a snowstorm. “A shining star,”\\n\\x0che said of her. “She was always a shining star and now she is one forever.”\\n\\nWorking in this field I had long ago given up the effort of trying to hold back\\nmy tears. The more I evolved, the more naturally my emotions were expressed\\nanyway, without thought. So much effort in society is put into keeping up\\nappearances, but it all comes at too high a price.\\n\\nThe honesty of my own emotions also helped the families at times, as it gave\\nthem permission to let their own tears flow. Some people had not allowed\\nthemselves to cry for their whole adult life. More and more I had become an\\nadvocate for honesty. So it was that an occasional tear fell as Lenny shared his\\nstories with me. There was just something about the beauty of this man and the\\nway he told his story that triggered it, I think.\\n\\nLenny’s youngest son had been too sensitive for the world and spiralled into\\nmental illness. In those days, the support systems were not in place for this and if\\nthe family could not cope completely, patients were admitted to mental asylums.\\nLenny and Rita wanted to keep Alistair at home in a loving environment, but\\nwere not allowed to by doctors. Alistair spent the rest of his years in a drugged\\nhaze and Lenny never saw him smile again.\\n\\nTheir remaining daughter now lived in Dubai, where her husband had a\\nconstruction contract. She phoned the nursing home while I was working and\\nspoke with me. She was a nice person to speak with, but unable to get home to\\nher father.\\n\\nHis love Rita had died in her late forties, only a few years after they had lost\\nAlistair to the mental health system. From Rita’s diagnosis to her departure, it\\nwas only a matter of weeks. Yet here was this lovely man telling me he had hada\\ngood life. Through tears, I asked how he saw it that way. “I have known love and\\nit is love that has not lessened for one day in all of these years,” he told me.\\n\\nI found myself not wanting to go home at the end of the shift, but Lenny\\nneeded his rest anyway. As I returned each day, I prayed he would still be there.\\nIt was a difficult thing in a way. I knew he wanted to go, to be with Rita again\\nand to the children he had lost. In that regard, I wished for him a speedy\\ndeparture. But for my own growth and connection with him, I wanted to hold on\\nas long as I could.\\n\\nHe had worked hard, too hard he said. But it had numbed his pain initially and\\nhe didn’t know any other way to deal with his losses. In later years, on the\\nrecommendation of Rose, his daughter in Dubai, he had sought counselling and\\nhad learned to speak of it all. Talking of his losses had healed him well and he\\nwas now able to speak about his life freely. I told him I was grateful he could.\\n\\x0cHe asked me about my life and found it fascinating how a young woman\\nwould sell all of her belongings, pack up her car and head off into a new life,\\nwith no idea at all of where she would end up. And that she had done this quite\\noften.\\n\\nI explained how much my first serious relationship had affected my life. There\\nwere parts of me too back then, yet to be discovered (as there always will be).\\nThe suppression experienced at the time though, seemed to create a tantalising\\ninvitation from the unknown life. When the relationship was finally over, I felt a\\nsense of freedom I had never known. I had met him when I very young, so had\\nnever truly known the freedom of adult life. By the end of the relationship, I was\\ntwenty-three and starting to do what all twenty-three year olds should be doing —\\nhaving fun.\\n\\nDriving six hours to a friend’s wedding a few months later, I discovered a part\\nof myself that was like coming home. Simply, a part of me belonged on the road\\nand always would. It was the most natural thing in the world for me to be driving\\nlong distances. Since then, my freedom had become one of the biggest driving\\nforces of who I was. Most of my decisions were based on how they would affect\\nmy freedom and I shaped my life accordingly. Of course freedom can be\\nobtained in a regular life too. It is a state of mind more than anything. The\\nfreedom to be you is the greatest freedom of all, regardless of the town or suburb\\nyou live in.\\n\\nLenny said that many partners think they own each other. While there was\\ndefinitely a need for compromise and commitment in any relationship, especially\\nso if children are involved, it is up to each individual to maintain a sense of his\\nor her own self. He questioned me more about my life with genuine curiosity,\\nand listened too when I told him I was thinking about moving on from this work.\\n“Yes,” he said. “There is a good life waiting for you Bronnie, without having to\\nspend all of your time around death. Get back amongst the living.” He was a\\ndear man and I smiled at his blessing.\\n\\nThe nursing home was run by a Christian denomination. Lenny had stopped\\ngoing to church after Rita had died. Not because he didn’t believe anymore, but\\nbecause it was too painful for him to be there without hearing his beautiful\\nwife’s voice singing in the pew beside him. Lenny said he didn’t care whether it\\nwas a Christian nursing home, one run by any other religion, or one run by no\\nreligion at all. He would have made the best of any situation. Either way, he was\\ngoing home to Rita soon and that’s all he cared about. But Christian it was and\\nthere were many volunteers there as well as staff.\\n\\x0cOne of these was a man named Roy who would do the rounds, reading to the\\nresidents from the Bible each day. He had offered his services to Lenny months\\nearlier, which Lenny had politely declined. Roy had persisted and offered them\\nagain on numerous occasions since, each time Lenny again politely declining.\\n\\nNow that Lenny was in his last days, with no strength to resist, Roy brought it\\nupon himself to come in every afternoon and read passages from the Bible to\\nhim. He read for a long time. Even a well person, and one who was totally\\ndevoted to Bible study, would have grown a little weary by the end of his\\nmonotone delivery every day. Through politeness I also did my best to stay\\nattentive as Roy read on. But sometimes I too nodded off without meaning to.\\nLike I say, he read for a long time with no expression, a very long time.\\n\\nEven worse was that Roy would then want to discuss the passage he had read\\nwith Lenny. As Lenny’s carer, my priority was the well being of the client. So I\\ngently explained that Lenny was only able to speak when he had the energy to,\\nwhich was true, and should not be forced.\\n\\n“T know you’re a lovely lady Bronnie,” Lenny said to me quietly one day, after\\nRoy had moved onto another room. “And I know you like to think well of\\npeople. But if that bloke comes back in here again I am going to boot his butt\\nfrom here to Timbuktu.” We both laughed aloud, knowing full well that Roy\\nwould be back at the same time tomorrow.\\n\\n“If I am not going to Heaven by now, then what’s the point of all of this\\nreligious stuff anyway?” he chuckled. “I can’t concentrate on what he is saying\\nregardless. I don’t have the energy.”\\n\\n“His intention is kind Lenny. That is the main thing surely,” I replied. We both\\nlaughed gently about the situation. Roy was a sweet man and although it was\\nobvious he meant kindly, it was becoming a bit of a comedy sketch. Each\\nafternoon when he arrived, we both knew what we were in for. He was really not\\ndoing the wise words of the Bible any justice through his monotonous, lifeless\\ndelivery. “You can sleep through it at least,” I laughed. Lenny nodded to me,\\nsmiling.\\n\\nThe days were wearing on and other work had been offered to me but I\\ndeclined. I wanted to see this beautiful man out, if it worked out that way. I was\\nfeeling a loyalty to his daughter Rose too. It would be awful to think her dad is\\ndying in another country and he has a new person to deal with every day. I also\\nknew I would miss our quiet talks soon enough and didn’t want to give them up\\nany sooner than I had to. As it turned out, that time came around very quickly\\nanyway.\\n\\x0cIt was a busy Thursday afternoon in the busy suburb. Everything was busy, the\\nroads, the shops, and then the nursing home when I arrived. Staff members with\\nfood trolleys were buzzing about the corridors. Doctors were doing their rounds.\\nNurses rushed about with more work than they could handle. Patients were\\nwheeled about in their big chairs, some of them drooling out the sides of their\\nmouth, staring vacantly into space. Nursing homes were such tragically sad\\nscenes and today was no different.\\n\\nAs I walked past, office girls were moaning to each other about another office\\ngirl. I wondered how they could be so surrounded by death and yet still put their\\nenergy into complaining about trivial things. But by then, I’d already had the\\nblessings of learning from many beautiful clients and from my own life. The\\nthings most people give their energy to are so irrelevant in the long run.\\n\\nAs usual, from the moment I walked into Lenny’s room, it was like being in a\\ndifferent world. The peace in this slightly darkened room was felt the moment\\nyou entered. It had been this way from the start and I had commented on it the\\nfirst day to Lenny. He had smiled. “Ah yes, it is a peaceful space. But it takes a\\ncertain person to recognise it. So many of the staff here come in with all of their\\nbusyness and miss the feel of the room completely.” I observed this afterwards.\\nA few of his visitors were peaceful people though, and they felt it immediately\\ntoo, which was nice.\\n\\nDragging the chair closer to Lenny as he lay sleeping, I read a book for a\\nwhile. But my mind was on him. He stirred after some time and saw I was there.\\nPatting his hand on the bed for my hand, I gave it to him. Smiling he drifted\\nback to sleep and the hours went by. Every now and then he would stir and I\\nwould give him a sip of drink or just kiss his hand.\\n\\n“Tt’s been a good life,” he said quietly from the silence as he woke. “It’s been a\\ngood life.” He drifted off again as I watched lovingly. My heart was aching and a\\nfew tears started falling. I wondered why I couldn’t have settled for an easier job\\nwith no emotional attachment. It was just too painful at times. Yet I knew that\\nother jobs didn’t come with the gifts I also received in knowing my clients.\\n\\n“Mmm. A good life,” he repeated, opening his weary eyes again and smiling at\\nme. Seeing my tears, he squeezed my hand. “Don’t you worry my girl, I’m\\nready.” His voice was almost a whisper. “Promise me something.”\\n\\nI wanted to sob but I just smiled through my tears. It was one of those smiles\\nthat aren’t really smiles, just a sign of someone trying to be brave but not\\nsucceeding. “Of course, Len.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about the little stuff. None of it matters. Only love matters. If\\n\\x0cyou remember this, that love is always present; it will be a good life.” His\\nbreathing was changing and it was getting harder for him to talk.\\n\\n“Thanks for everything Len,” I managed through my tears. “I’m so glad we\\nmet.” They seemed like such childish words in a way, as there was so much\\nmore I could have said and wanted to. But in the end, they conveyed my feelings\\nin the simplest way. Leaning over and kissing his forehead, I saw that he was\\ndrifting off again.\\n\\nI sat there allowing my tears to flow freely. Sometimes it takes just loosening\\nthe tap on tears to find there is a whole collection of them waiting to pour out.\\nYou don’t even know what they are all for. I had loosened the tap and cried and\\ncried. But Lenny continued to sleep through the next few hours. It was possible\\nhe would never wake again. When my tears were drained, I sat quietly, looking\\nat him with tenderness. Then of course, in walked Roy.\\n\\nI wanted to laugh, knowing Lenny would see the humour of the situation if he\\nhad been awake. But he wasn’t awake and my gentle smile to Roy, through eyes\\nbloodshot and tired from buckets of tears, told him the full picture. Lenny may\\nnot wake up again.\\n\\nA few slow tears of love fell again. But it was no longer a torrent of sorrow,\\nand they eased off before long. I think it was seeing Roy’s sweet face and\\nknowing his kind intentions that had set me off, even if a part of me knew that\\nLenny didn’t particularly want him there.\\n\\nRoy sat on the other side of the bed. He opened his Bible to start reading but\\nlooked to me for approval. I just pulled a face that said, “Well, it’s up to you, but\\nI think he’d like the peace”. He nodded. The Bible stayed open in his hands but\\nhe didn’t read. I loved him then for respecting the reverence of the moment. It’s\\nnot that him reading the Bible would not have been a reverent intention. But it\\nwasn’t necessary in the already existing sacredness of the moment.\\n\\nLenny reached for my hand with his eyes still closed. I stood up and gave it to\\nhim. His breathing was rattling and irregular. I could smell what had now\\nbecome too familiar to me, but which is impossible to describe. It was the smell\\nof death.\\n\\nThen opening his eyes, Lenny looked straight at me and smiled. But it wasn’t\\nmy mate Lenny who I had come to know. It was Lenny and the full glory of his\\nsoul. There was no illness in his smile. It was one of a soul now free of ego and\\npersonality.\\n\\nIt was pure love, completely free of everything else, radiant, glowing, and\\njoyous.\\n\\x0cI smiled back with honesty as my heart burst open. Both of us smiled joyfully,\\nknowing it is all just love in the end. I’d never known such absolutely\\nuninhibited smiling, given or received. There was nothing in the way. It was just\\npure joy. As we both smiled into each other beaming, time was frozen.\\n\\nAfter a while, Lenny closed his eyes and a peaceful smile remained on his lips.\\nMy own smile remained, as my heart was just too open to stop smiling.\\n\\nA couple of minutes later, Lenny passed on.\\n\\nWatching from the other side of the bed, Roy’s life was transformed. Closing\\nhis Bible, he said quietly that he now understood what God’s love looked like\\nand felt he had experienced a miracle seeing Lenny’s peace before passing. I\\nagreed that God works in mysterious ways.\\n\\nRoy and I sat in the silence for a while longer. I knew the moment would be\\ngone as soon as I notified the staff, which I needed to do before long. When we\\nsaid goodbye, Roy held my hand for a long time, trying to find the right words,\\nunsure what to say or how to articulate what had happened. He seemed hesitant\\nto let me go, as if it would pop his balloon if he didn’t have me there to share the\\nstory.\\n\\n“We’ve been blessed Roy. That’s all we need to know,” I said to him gently.\\nHe grabbed me and hugged me tightly, like a frightened child, not wanting to be\\nalone with it. “You’re going to be alright Roy.”\\n\\n“How do I explain this to anyone?” he pleaded with me.\\n\\n“Perhaps you don’t,” I smiled. “Or perhaps you do. Either way, the same force\\nthat just gave us that miracle, will be there for you again to help you say the right\\nwords if you need to share them.”\\n\\nShaking his head, but with a smile of joy he said, “My life will never be the\\nsame”. I smiled lovingly at him and we hugged again.\\n\\nWhen all of the paperwork was done, I left the nursing home. There was too\\nmuch activity now around Lenny’s body and we’d had our time. Peak hour\\ntraffic had gone and the late afternoon light shone spectacularly on the tree-lined\\navenue I walked. My heart was open and smiling. I was in love with everything\\nand everyone.\\n\\nYes, the job had had its ups and downs. But no amount of planning or\\nqualifications could have ever given me the gifts that this role had bestowed\\nupon me time after time.\\n\\nStill euphoric from the gift of love I had been given, tears of joy and gratitude\\nfell as I walked with a huge smile.\\n\\nYes. It is a good life Lenny. It is a good life indeed.\\n\\x0cCHANGING TIMES\\neter\\n\\nCaring for so many dying people had left me both elated and exhausted.\\nCountless positive changes had unfolded in my life as a result, but I was\\ndefinitely ready for a change and pursued the idea of teaching songwriting in the\\nwomen’s prison system.\\n\\nThere was a lot of red tape and much to learn about the private philanthropic\\nsector — which foundations had funding guidelines available that my project\\nwould fit into, and how to make the applications. Some of my guidance came\\nfrom a group of women who had been doing theatre workshops in jails for\\nseveral years. As it turned out, I had been living right next door to them during\\nmy first Melbourne chapter almost a decade ago. Back then though, I hadn’t\\neven written my first song. So I was hardly in the position to set up a\\nsongwriting program, but it was strangely delightful to walk down that street\\nagain to their place, all the while gauging the changes in my life and self since\\nliving there.\\n\\nMy initial efforts brought no success in any jails in Victoria, so I decided to try\\nfor New South Wales. Also, I was conducting a long-distance relationship with a\\nman in New South Wales. I didn’t think the relationship was going to work but it\\nhad a better chance if we were closer together rather than being separated by a\\nthousand kilometres. A delightful cousin also lived in the area chosen and\\noffered to put me up while I found somewhere to live.\\n\\nLiz, who had taken me under her wing months earlier, was my greatest help\\nthrough the whole establishment process for the jail program. Her insistence that\\nanything can be done by using networks of people and linking the right ones up,\\nkept me encouraged. I was also reminded of words from many clients, in that\\nnothing good can be done alone. We need to work together. Liz also educated me\\non the need to find an auspice for the funding. Most philanthropic foundations\\nrequired a charity to receive the funds on my behalf, enabling the foundation to\\nenjoy the tax concessions that come with donating to charity groups. I would\\nthen invoice the charity for the full amount and draw on that as my wage, as a\\nself-employed person. Finding an organisation willing to channel these funds\\nwas somewhat challenging initially. As life would have it though, I was\\n\\x0creminded again of the cycles of life and how often we do a full circle.\\n\\nPrior to moving to the country town I grew up in, my family had lived on the\\noutskirts of Sydney. In those days, in the seventies, it was a rural area. My first\\nyear of schooling was undertaken there. Now, after numerous phone calls and\\nemails, the auspice door finally opened to me, via the church connected with my\\nvery first school. Thirty-five years had past and there I was sitting in an office,\\noverlooking the playground I knew as a little girl in kindergarten. It added such\\nbeautiful sentimentality to the jail process for me.\\n\\nThe enthusiasm from the Senior Education Officer at the women’s jail I chose\\nalso kept me hanging in there when funding applications became challenging.\\nShe was a progressive, enthusiastic woman and marketed my proposal to her\\nregional management with complete belief in my vision. I had contacted two\\nwomen’s jails initially, but the differences of support offered were enormous.\\nOne said they would not even supply pens and notebooks. I would have to do\\nthat myself. The other offered not only those, but also guitars and anything else\\nthey could assist with. As I became more involved in the process, it became\\nobvious that dealing with one jail and one class would be more than enough\\nanyway. The choice of which of those jails to go with was very clear.\\n\\nFor ages things seemed like they weren’t moving, but when it finally fell into\\nplace, it moved like lightning and I was on the road north within a couple of\\ndays. For a month or so I lived with my cousin and her huge family. It was\\nstrange but wonderful to be around so many people again, after the quietness of\\nmy work and previous home situation. The house was pretty crazy with three\\ngenerations living there, as well as seven cats and three dogs, but the longing for\\nmy own kitchen could not be ignored and despite hearing that rentals were hard\\nto get, I found a cottage the day after I decided it was time. It was up in the\\nlower Blue Mountains, with a creek and bush land across the road and was as\\ncute as a button.\\n\\nWith no belongings at all to live with, I wasn’t fazed. It felt right and the\\ncottage had come my way so easily that my faith was strong. Everything I\\nneeded would come and come it did. It poured forth in a torrent. The owners of a\\nstorage shed business offered me some things they had been asked to clear out, a\\nlounge from one shed, some linen supplies from another. My cousin had lived in\\nthe area for decades and had an established community of friends. Through that,\\na washing machine came my way from under someone’s house. Then a fridge\\narrived, as did bookshelves, kitchen things, curtains, and an antique desk. A huge\\nnetwork of people pitched in with excitement, giving me whatever they could,\\n\\x0cfascinated by my situation, and just being good-hearted people. It was beautiful.\\n\\nI bought a van as soon as I arrived in New South Wales. Although I wanted to\\nsomewhat settle, I was also going to quite a few folk festivals and had been\\nmissing owning a bed on wheels. It was more my style than pitching a tent at\\nfestivals and helped me maintain a sense of freedom, knowing I could still go\\naway whenever I wanted and to anywhere. My timing for the van purchase and\\nthe move into the cottage was also spot-on. I moved in the same month as the\\nannual council cleanup was on in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nFurniture that people no longer wanted was left out on sidewalks, to be thrown\\nout or collected by whoever would like it, before the council’s rubbish truck\\narrived. People waved to me from their verandahs as I collected small things\\nfrom their piles, smiling and encouraging me to take whatever I wanted — a cane\\nwashing basket, a narrow cupboard for my pantry, an outside table. I also picked\\nup quite a few classic pieces of furniture. Previous owners even helped me to\\nload some of the things into my van themselves, including an old but great\\nlounge for my verandah.\\n\\nI also attended lots of bargain filled garage sales and had immense fun in the\\nprocess. The only thing I cared about getting new was a mattress. I wanted one\\nthat was good for my back and one that no one else had slept on, with just my\\nenergy on it. A beautiful woman I knew a little gave me a housewarming\\npresent, because she was excited that I was settling down after so many years.\\nThe gift was exactly the cost of a mattress. So within three weeks, I went from\\nhaving six boxes that fitted into a small car to having a fully furnished two-\\nbedroom cottage that looked like I had lived in it for years. It was a fantastic\\ntime.\\n\\nThe first night there, I lay in the middle of the living room floor with my arms\\noutstretched and smiled hugely. My own space! At last, I had my own space\\nagain. The relief, gratitude and joy were so overwhelming that hardly anyone\\nsaw me for a month. I just couldn’t bear to leave the house except for work.\\nWhen I’d return home, I’d look at my place and be smiling all over again.\\n\\nWhile I was not successful in getting the full amount of funds I had applied\\nfor, I was able to get the prison program started with what I did receive, thinking\\nI would look at applying for further funding as time unfolded, through other\\nfoundations. Even receiving the funds I did though was a very exciting\\nachievement, to have watched this idea turn into a reality. As the funding was\\nprovided through the private philanthropic sector and the prison system did not\\nhave to pay me, I was a volunteer in their eyes. My course outline had been\\n\\x0capproved. I demonstrated what I hoped to teach and achieve. Because my\\nprogram was not an accredited one, I was not required to have teaching\\nqualifications. The staff in the Education Department simply believed in my\\nideas and ability as I did, and were able to gain approval based on that, which in\\nhindsight is rather fantastic really! At the time though, I didn’t see it as\\nparticularly unusual, as I was just going along with each step as it unfolded until\\nI finally found myself standing in front of a room full of convicted criminals,\\nteaching them songwriting!\\n\\nHaving never taught in any classroom environment in my life and to now be\\nstanding there with dozens of eyes on me, many unfriendly, was pretty\\ninteresting. It may have been daunting if I stopped to think about it, but I didn’t.\\nI just got on with the job. Until I’d started liaising with the department, I had\\nnever been inside a jail either. So with lesson one prepared and a lot of guts, I\\nbegan the class. It took some pretty dry humour to get any reaction at first as\\neveryone just sat there stone faced, checking me out, and needing to stay cool in\\nfront of each other. But after a while, the women realised I was OK.\\n\\nWe were doing rhyming exercises and instead of using some of the examples I\\nhad intended from my lesson plan, I began improvising and making the rhymes\\nfunnier and more relevant to the situation, laughing at myself with them.\\n\\n“I’m sitting here in my greens hoping for some tunes,\\n\\nIs she just going to talk rhyming words all damn afternoon?\\nI want to learn to play guitar and be like Emmylou\\n\\nSo Pll stick it out with her a while, what else can I do?”\\n\\nSome of the women then started to giggle and contribute to the class, adding\\nmore jokes, which enabled the rest of the inmates to relax and have a say too.\\n\\n“So come on Miss get on with it and teach us what to do\\n‘Cos for rhyming we don’ give a shit and we wish you wouldnt too.”\\n\\nLaughter broke the ice forever. Also, once we found a shared theme, in this\\ncase the music of Emmylou Harris, we were well and truly off and running.\\n\\n“OK OK I hear you all but there are things you must learn\\nSo humour me and do these rhymes, guitars then you will earn\\nYou will soon be playing songs from your own heart\\n\\x0cBut the longer you put off this stuff, the later you will start.”\\nIn reply I received:\\n\\n“OK Miss if we must, we will write these silly rhymes\\nBut don‘ linger with this stuff too long, I want a guitar that’s mine.”\\n\\nThe banter continued in rhymes and by the end of that first class, laughter was\\nflowing freely. Most of the women were contributing well. It turned out to be\\ngreat fun.\\n\\nAll of the people in the Education Department were good-hearted and it was\\nnice to be working in a team environment again, after so much one-on-one work\\nwith clients in their homes. They warned me though to not get too close to the\\ninmates and I understood this for security and privacy reasons. But I could only\\nbe myself and saw the students not as inmates, but as women learning to play the\\nguitar and write songs. I was street-wise enough to remember I was in a jail but I\\nalso lived by honesty, so I could still only be myself.\\n\\nAs a result of my sincerity and belief in each of them, barriers between us\\nwere dismantled over time as trust was established and strengthened. We chatted\\nas women and my encouragement for them to show their softer sides through\\nsongwriting allowed them to gradually remove the emotional walls they had\\nbuilt to protect themselves. The class became a very personal and healing space\\nfor the students. It was from this healing perspective I continued to design the\\ncurriculum.\\n\\nUsing various writing exercises, the women learned to release their emotions\\nand eventually to write with hope. Songs of anger and hurt were written,\\ncertainly. There were songs of dreams and aspirations too though. When asked if\\nthey could do anything, if there were no limits on them in anyway, no financial,\\ngeographical, skills-based limits, what would they do, they began dreaming and\\nlistening to their hearts for the first time in years. One wanted the freedom to live\\nwith her children without answering to government departments, another said\\nshe would be in a music video, one would have a tummy-tuck, another wanted to\\nknow life without domestic violence (which she had never known), one wished\\nshe could be free of her drug addictions forever, and another wanted to visit\\nHeaven and tell her mum she loved her.\\n\\nAs the honesty continued to flow, very few classes went by where tears were\\nnot shed. But we had made a pact it was to be a supportive environment, no\\n\\x0cmatter what. So women who once did not get along became tolerant and\\neventually supportive of each other in class. One woman was not even going to\\njoin the class due to another’s presence. She did though and within about four\\nclasses, they were giving each other genuine encouragement for their songs and\\ngetting along well out in the yard too. This was the nature of the class. The\\ncourage it took to express themselves so honestly gained the respect of the\\nothers, as they empathised and listened with genuine interest as each of their\\nsongs evolved.\\n\\nIt was also hugely confronting for them to learn to perform in front of the\\nclass. They encouraged each other though, feeling the pain of their song’s\\nmessages. One student, Sandy, wrote about how hard it had been as a half\\nAboriginal, half white woman, who didn’t quite fit into either part of the town\\nshe lived in. Others in the class knew the same feeling and kept her encouraged,\\nreinforcing the need for these things to be expressed.\\n\\nAnother, Daisy, had been in and out of jail so many times, mostly due to\\nviolence, that she didn’t even know how long she was in for this time. She said\\nshe would go numb and tune out whenever she was in a courtroom, as it just\\noverwhelmed her. (She was going to find out the length of her sentence soon\\nafter). So she wrote about those feeling and how much she hated that her life was\\nnow a part of the system and never felt like her own anymore. Another student,\\nLisa, wrote a song for her son telling him how proud she was of him. She choked\\nup with emotions every time she played it, but was very proud of herself too.\\n\\nPerforming these songs in class was cathartic for them, as it allowed full\\nexpression, not just written expression, despite how it would challenge their\\nnerves too. But having been in this place emotionally myself years earlier, just as\\nshy and nervous, I encouraged them gently and the emotional walls of fear\\nslowly crumbled. A few months later when one of my students, who had initially\\nbeen very timid, played one of her new original songs solo in front of over a\\nhundred inmates and visitors, it was me who was crying, joyfully.\\n\\nThe class numbers were not huge, but this suited everyone. The first few\\nclasses were overflowing, too big for efficiency, but after that it was usually\\nabout ten regular students. Others would come and go, but when they realised\\nthey wouldn’t learn to play the guitar like Eric Clapton in one class, and more so,\\nthat the class involved genuine work, not all hung around. It was best that the\\nclasses were small. These were women who needed a lot of attention and this\\nway, I was able to attend to each of them individually. The songs and stories\\ncoming out were inspiring, healing and beautiful. The love that flowed between\\n\\x0cus all was nurturing, to say the least. Underneath the hardened exteriors were\\npeople like you or me — people who loved their children, yearned for love and\\nrespect, wanted to feel useful and live self respecting lives.\\n\\nVery few of the women were without guilt for what they had done. Most\\nwanted to be better people. When I came to know each of their personal stories\\nthough, all I could see were tragic histories, very low self-esteem, and a cycle\\nthey couldn’t break out. They were in for various crimes, some for working\\nillegally as prostitutes. In that regard, some women actually worked the system\\nto their advantage. They knew the sentence length of many petty crimes so\\nwould commit one each year, enabling them to get off the cold streets for three\\nmonths over winter, where they would at least have a warm bed in jail and\\nregular meals. Others were in there for crimes ranging from drug use or\\npossession, violence, fraud, shop-lifting (a habit she got into to feed her family\\nthen became addicted to), and driving under the influence of alcohol too many\\ntimes.\\n\\nRegardless of the actual crime though, the prison system treated the crime, the\\neffects, not their wounds, which were the underlying causes of their actions.\\nWhile it was called a correctional facility, there was only limited help available\\nfor anyone seriously wanting to change their thinking and past patterns. This is\\nthe level where the healing was most needed, to break the cycles of low self-\\nesteem, drug use, domestic violence, and the criminal life that had flowed from\\nthat. Perhaps some criminals would still commit crimes if given help. But those I\\ncame to know would certainly have changed their habits if given ongoing\\nsupport in and beyond their jail-time.\\n\\nThere were some lovely people working in the system itself, but they were\\nalso up against it. There were also volunteers from church groups who managed\\nto reach a few individuals, helping them to turn their lives around. The truth is\\nthat much more money was spent on security and red tape than on methods of\\nhealing and support. In a jail of about three hundred inmates, there were only\\ntwo psychologists, and they were often unavailable because of lack of time and\\nbeing overly committed. If you didn’t already feel pretty low about yourself\\nbefore you lived in a jail, you would certainly do so during and after.\\n\\nHaving watched an informative documentary about the success of meditation\\nin jails and in turning people’s lives around, I mentioned this to some of the staff\\nand how I could put the right people in touch with them. The meditation path I\\nfollowed had had success with teaching inmates meditation in other countries,\\nbut I was told ‘Good luck’, with a laugh and total discouragement. So instead, I\\n\\x0cworked within the capacity I could and that was with the students in my class, by\\nhelping them to start believing in their own beauty and goodness. I did this\\nthrough teaching them songwriting and how to express themselves through\\noriginal songs, songs they owned and could perform and share with others.\\nMany of them had never had a compliment in their lives and were like a sponge\\nwith the positive feedback I gave them, all of which was genuine. Any\\nsuggestion for improvement of their songs was always delivered through gentle\\nappraisal.\\n\\nThere were funny times too as they grew to trust me, educating me about life\\nout in the yard. One day, one of the women was talking loudly to another about\\nhow she’d managed to score an extra pair of running shoes. When she realised I\\nhad heard her, she shut up immediately. With encouragement from me and other\\nstudents, she explained the scheme to me. I commented that it was pretty clever\\nthinking, only to hear, “Well, we are crims Miss. Remember where you are”, to\\nwhich I cracked up laughing. By that time I had gained confidence and wasn’t at\\nall intimidated, so I found this statement rather funny.\\n\\nAnother student came to class one week looking quite wound up, yet\\nexhausted at the same time. When I questioned if she was OK, she said, “Yeah\\nI’m fine now Miss. I’ve just had a terrible morning. This chick has been giving\\nme the shits for ages so I put her head inside a clothes dryer. It’s fine now”. With\\nslight astonishment I nodded, as if saying ‘I see’. “Anyway Miss, it’s all good.\\nI’m here and it’s time for music. None of that matters when I’m here. If I didn’t\\nhave this class to come to, I might have killed her. But they’d ban me from this\\nclass and that would kill me.” With that, she sat down and continued working on\\nher song from the previous week. She was actually a brilliant songwriter with\\none of the nicest voices I’ve known. I wish we had met through other\\ncircumstances, as I would have loved to share songs around a campfire with her.\\nThat was never going to happen though.\\n\\nOne week at a time, more and more positive transformations were unfolding.\\nIt was rewarding and beautiful to see. The staff members in the Education\\nDepartment were also delighted with the success and positive changes in many\\nof the students who came through the program. The class soon became the\\nhighlight of their week and mine.\\n\\nBy now I had ended the long-distance relationship I had been in, despite now\\nliving closer to each other. I was never going to be able to move in the direction\\nmy heart was calling by staying with that man. Our values were just too\\ndifferent. While there were tears shed and necessary growth through the sad\\n\\x0cprocess of letting go, I had come too far in myself to now start living a lifestyle\\nuntrue to my own values.\\n\\nHome life was beautiful and I delighted in playing host to friends who visited\\noccasionally, instead of me doing all of the visiting as in the last decade or two.\\nAfter so much roaming, it was not entirely surprising to find myself very much\\nbecoming a home person. It was rare that I would feel any inclination to go\\nanywhere and I decided that in the long-term, I definitely wanted to work from\\nhome more.\\n\\nSo during my spare time, I developed an online songwriting course, based on\\nwhat I was teaching to the women in the jail. My writing was also gaining\\nmomentum, with articles being published in various magazines, and I was\\nwriting a blog. This began gaining a lot of followers, which reinforced how\\nmuch I loved connecting with like-minded people through my work. It also left\\nme questioning if I wanted to keep doing the hard life of a performer. While\\nteaching in the jail, my own music had slowed down a bit, though I was still\\ndoing some quality gigs now and then. When I was connecting with the right\\naudiences and was totally lost in the music, I loved it, but writing and working\\nfrom home began to bring more contentment.\\n\\nAlthough the cottage and the jail job were wonderful, there wasn’t much else\\nto keep me in the area. Friends had moved on and life had changed since I’d\\npreviously lived nearby in Sydney. There was also a part of me that knew I\\nwould eventually end up living back in the country one day. In more than two\\ndecades of roaming, I had never lost the yearning for space that farm life gives. I\\ndidn’t make many friends in the new area, as I was becoming more reclusive and\\nloving being in my own place after years of roaming.\\n\\nSo without any true conscious awareness on my behalf, the students became\\nmy most local friends. Over time, the walls between teacher and student, or\\nemployee and inmates fell down considerably. The class simply became a place\\nwhere a group of women played music. I felt there wasn’t that much separating\\nthe inmates from me and at times, I could have just as easily been one of them.\\nThat’s how it felt sometimes anyway. Certainly there were other moments when\\nI didn’t feel quite so much that way. I hadn’t committed a crime to validate me\\nbeing there, but there was always closeness between us, as women who were\\nbonded by the honesty we experienced. My own fragility and painful past was\\nalso still shaping me in some ways, although nowhere near as much as\\npreviously. So this possibly strengthened the connection with the students, as\\ntheir own pasts were full of pain, various kinds of abuse, and a lack of self worth\\n\\x0calso resulting from that.\\n\\nWhen first arriving in the jail, I was guided how to deflect questions about my\\npersonal life. While I never told them where I lived, when they had asked I’d\\nsimply said I couldn’t tell them, rather than point in some abstract direction or\\nlie. The women were respectful of this, as trust now existed, but I answered the\\nquestions I could. Through all of the honest conversations with dying clients in\\nthe past, I’d also come to enjoy being more open. The emotional walls of privacy\\njust block goodness out. Truth brings people together. They asked questions\\nabout my past and I replied honestly, explaining what I had stupidly tolerated\\nfrom others and believed for too long.\\n\\nThe kindness from these women as a group and individually woke something\\nup in me that had been dormant for a very long time. Simply, I didn’t know how\\nto receive kindness. I knew how to give it, but not receive it. So when I felt their\\nlove for me, and their genuine understanding of my pain, it was overwhelming.\\nThese really were the kindest and most beautiful of women. They had all\\nsuffered and many of them were missing their children and families with\\nenormous longing. Yet their hearts were incredibly kind. Sure, they had messed\\nup and made mistakes, ending up in jail, but few were without regret and none\\nwere without a good and loving heart.\\n\\nThe funding was running out and after almost a year in the jail, I accepted that\\nI wasn’t only burning out from looking after dying people. I was actually\\nburning out from life. There was just too much sadness around me. When\\ntragedy happened to a couple of close friends and I tried to be there, life became\\neven harder. Knowing how difficult it was to get the first round of funding, I\\nwondered if I had the energy to do it all over again. Falling asleep that night,\\nlistening to my new neighbours having a screaming match with each other, my\\ndecision was made. It was time to return to country life. I had done all I was\\ncapable of doing at this point.\\n\\nMost of my original students had been released by now or were about to be, so\\nthis freed me up a lot. Having the clarity and energy to teach new students was\\nnot going to be possible. It was time to learn how to look after me. So I gave my\\nnotice at the jail and to the landlord, and began making plans.\\n\\nMy parents were getting older. Mum and I were as beautifully close as always\\nin our friendship and I was enjoying a lovely relationship with my dad. So I\\nwanted to be closer and more accessible to them, at least within a few hours\\ndrive. This is not far in an Australian’s perception of distance. I also wanted to\\nlive somewhere nearer the coast.\\n\\x0cThe suitable area was chosen and I began scanning the Internet pages of house\\nrentals. I decided which two towns I wanted to live between and what my rent\\nlimit would be. When nothing suitable had presented itself within a couple of\\nweeks, I put an advertisement in the local paper, stating clearly what I was\\nlooking for. A couple of situations were offered, though neither felt right, but I\\nmade new contacts and the availability of a great little cottage came to my\\nattention very soon after. It was exactly where I had wanted, for exactly the\\namount of rent I could afford and before I knew it, I was living on a two\\nthousand acre farm.\\n\\x0cDARKNESS AND DAWN\\neter\\n\\nA running creek passed in front of the cottage, which brought an ever-changing\\nscene of wildlife and beauty. Magnificent, enormous trees dotted the landscape.\\nBirds sang to me all day while frogs sang all night. Millions of stars, not\\nstreetlights, shone brightly overhead as each evening arrived. It was absolutely\\nbliss, particularly when I played my guitar watching the sunset from a perfect\\nverandah, or when the rain pelted down on the tin roof. I was in heaven and said\\nmany, many prayers of thanks.\\n\\nCountry life obviously has a lot of sacrifices when it comes to easily accessing\\nlive entertainment and the arts, but there was enough around to suit me. My\\nlifestyle would always take me away travelling somewhere on occasions\\nanyway. It didn’t matter. I was moving in rhythm with nature again and finally\\nliving the life that made the most sense to me. Five houses, including the\\nfarmer’s were dotted over the hills and valleys on these vast acres. As a tenant I\\nsimply had to enjoy the space.\\n\\nThings felt easier and lighter immediately. It was such a homecoming to be\\nliving in the country again. My energy was very low after caring for so many\\ndying people and then working in the jail, so I was happy to have a break and\\nlive off my savings for a little while. In the meantime, I would do some research\\non my new area and decide which direction to take when I was ready, following\\neach step as it would come to present itself. With each passing day I felt better,\\nslowly rejuvenating. Positive energy and thoughts were flowing again.\\nWandering over hills and paddocks, delighting in the simplicity and complexity\\nof nature, my healing and restoration was underway.\\n\\nThe previous years of growth, sitting at the bedsides of so many wonderful\\nand wise people, had definitely created a lot of positive shifts. I smiled in the\\nmemories, often recalling tender moments and beautiful conversations. Although\\nthat life seemed a long way behind me now, particularly as I walked the hills and\\nvalleys, it had shaped me hugely and I continued to feel overwhelmingly\\ngrateful.\\n\\nOther than needing to spend some time at home and to continue my creative\\njourney, I was out on a leap of faith yet again, trusting that the next steps would\\n\\x0csurely reveal themselves at the right time. After all, this was what had usually\\nhappened previously. With so much natural beauty around me, the writing and\\nmusic started to flow through marvellously. The abundance of natural life around\\nthe cottage and the creek helped me adapt to a very simple lifestyle in no time.\\n\\nWell below levels of my own consciousness though, destructive patterns of my\\nlow self-worth still lingered. On a conscious level, my thinking had been\\nchanged a great deal over the last decade and life felt easier than it had in years.\\nIn that regard, I was in a place of peace and gratitude, restoring myself with each\\nnew day. Emotionally, it was all flowing well. Or so I thought.\\n\\nThen out of the blue, things took a twist in an unforeseen direction. I had been\\ncruising along fine, so it buckled me completely when all of a sudden I was then\\nflung into the darkest depths of my healing. Up it all came from places far\\ndeeper than ever before. My remaining (and I had thought, restoring) energy\\ndisappeared completely, almost overnight, as if someone unplugged me from the\\npower socket and I slumped into a pile on the floor. It seemed to happen so\\nsuddenly. Every ounce of energy was absolutely gone.\\n\\nIdeas of finding any casual work to make some local contacts flew out the\\nwindow. The thought of facing anyone at all seemed impossible. Ideas of\\nworking in any job for even a short while became out of the question. I simply\\nwasn’t capable. I was forced to enter the very core of my being to face these\\nchanges and it was a heck of a rough ride. I didn’t have any choice though. It\\nwas coming up whether I liked it or not and once the tears began, there was no\\nstopping them. I needed to heal so that I could become the real person I had been\\nborn to become, to completely break free of my past. These months became the\\nhardest of my life, as I unexpectedly slid headfirst into a deep pit of suicidal\\ndepression.\\n\\nThose who knew me best could not believe that this was me. If I hadn’t been\\nthere myself, I may have felt the same. I’d seen depression firsthand in others\\npreviously and could never have imagined myself in such a place. But that’s the\\nthing with depression and that’s what makes it so hard initially for many\\nsufferers — the shock that it is happening to them.\\n\\nSome friends refused outright to believe it. How could this be Bronnie, the one\\nwho always lifted everyone else up, and was now on the crash and burn? Some\\nsimply didn’t know how to handle it, to see me in such a vulnerable place. The\\nsuggestions from other friends who phoned, people I thought who knew me very\\nwell, were so far from what I was capable of that it left me feeling even more\\nmisunderstood. If I could have been any sadder, it would have made me so. But I\\n\\x0ccouldn’t be, so it didn’t. The least of my worries was other people. All I was\\ncapable of attending to was myself — and not even that at times.\\n\\nThe suggestions continued from all angles though, as to how to change my\\nsituation. But what people with depression most need is acceptance. Depression\\nis an illness that can be the most catalytic gift for positive transformation, if one\\nis allowed to move through it at their own pace. Depression is the name given to\\nit in modern society. But it is in fact, an opportunity and enormous time for\\nspiritual transformation and awakening. It may be a breakdown. But it can also\\nbe a break-through, if approached with determination, the willingness to\\nsurrender, and faith. Of course, this doesn’t actually make it fun.\\n\\nWaking up sobbing before I’d even had my first thought for the day, I needed\\ncompassion and patience from those who knew me. Sometimes my waking\\nthoughts were not even conscious, the tears just poured forth the moment I\\nawoke slightly. At other times, it was the sadness for myself and my situation —\\nthat life just felt so impossibly hard these days, and really, had for years.\\nAcknowledging that I didn’t have the energy to start all over again yet knowing I\\nhad to, also overwhelmed me, as I couldn’t even imagine having the energy to\\ndo this, let alone find the energy. Nobody was going to walk to my front door\\nthough and offer me the perfect job, particularly when I hardly knew a person in\\nthe area.\\n\\nNo one in my closest circle really knew how to deal with my depth of sadness\\nand lack of strength, so they continued to phone with suggestions to get me out\\nand about again, to see me functioning. It just added pressure though, as I was\\ndefinitely not ready for that yet. If I managed to vacuum my house, which took\\nso much energy, it became a massive achievement, one I would acknowledge to\\nmyself — ‘You did well today Bronnie, you achieved something’. In previous\\ntimes, I could have vacuumed five houses, gone out to lunch, walked a few miles\\nand swum for an hour. But this is what depression is like when it first hits. It\\ncalls the shots initially.\\n\\nThe best thing friends and loved ones can do is to accept that this is where the\\nother person is. They may or may not come out of it. There is a good chance\\nthey will come through, especially if they want to. The acceptance from those\\nthey love supports this potential. Pressure though, just hinders it. The person\\nsuffering also needs to accept that this is where their life is at, in order to not put\\npressure on themselves, which in turn only exacerbates the symptoms. It took a\\nwhile for me to reach this place of acceptance in myself though, as I grappled\\nwith my inability to function in regular life.\\n\\x0cReturning to live on the land tapped into somewhere so deep within me that it\\naccessed pain buried from my youth and days as a young adult, when I had lived\\nin a similar setting. It seemed that by slowing down and returning to my roots as\\nsuch, as well as not putting all of my energy into looking after other people, the\\nlid had burst open from a tin of pain that had been securely and somewhat\\nforcefully shut decades ago. It had been seeping out gradually over the past\\ndecade as I had embarked on healing and releasing what I was conscious of.\\nNow though, the utter sadness that surfaced, so raw and painful, was from places\\nnot only conscious, but unconscious as well. Pain from years of criticism in my\\nyouth, from not being accepted as who I was even then, from all of the yelling\\nand ridicule I had been exposed to, all of the pain that had been stored without\\nme even realising it surfaced. I cried and cried.\\n\\nTo benefit from true healing, there is no other option but to face what is in\\nfront of you — the pain, the acknowledgment of your suffering, the opportunity\\nfor growth, the need for healing, and the need to find strength by eventually\\nbecoming stronger than the pain. No one can take our learning away though. No\\none else can do it for us. Love from others helps of course, and this flowing from\\nmy dear mother and a couple of old friends, was great support. There was no\\nescaping my own healing though. It was time to face myself. It was also time to\\nrelease things from the very deepest levels.\\n\\nThe release came in a variety of ways. Of course, there was crying. There was\\nalso writing things out. For the first time in my life I screamed too, not yelling,\\nbut truly screaming. (Actually I had squealed once, involuntarily, when I jumped\\nout of a plane). But this was screaming, in a primal way. I was so grateful to be\\nliving so far from other houses and to have the privacy to go through this turmoil\\nin whatever way each day dictated. I screamed all of the things I wished I had\\nsaid when I was younger and growing up, to people who had hurt me. I also\\nscreamed sounds of pain, with no words attached. I screamed for my utter\\nfrustration of being in the situation I was, for the level of pain I was\\nexperiencing. I sobbed uncontrollably. I lay exhausted, and little by little, I\\nhealed too.\\n\\nIn more sentimental times, I had often likened learning to be like a rose. We\\nunfold layer after layer of our beautiful, delicate selves, and eventually get to the\\ncentre, the bud of who we are. In such a state of utter sadness and hopelessness\\nthough, I threw that theory well and truly out the window and decided that\\ngrowth is more like peeling a very large onion. As we remove each new layer, it\\nbecomes even more painful and each layer just makes us cry harder. That’s what\\n\\x0cwas happening to me. I was peeling a full-strength onion, and a mighty big one\\nat that. Every tear shed, every sentence written, every thought shared, assisted a\\nnew layer to be peeled away.\\n\\nIt wasn’t happiness I was aiming for every day, just the strength to accept\\nwhere I was. There was little energy for anything initially except for crying and\\nthen from the verandah, watching as the world of nature unfolded before me.\\nExhausted from the waves of release that continued on a daily basis, every day\\nwas one of living presently. It was simply too hard at times to think beyond the\\nmoment I was in. Just surviving the intensity of emotions was enough on a day-\\nto-day basis. I was numb, emotionally worn out, and very, very tired with life.\\n\\nWhile I was reminded that happiness is a choice, choosing to challenge myself\\nand get out of bed, or to see a moment of something beautiful in between the\\ntears, were conscious choices in that direction. Choices and successes that\\nappeared as insignificant to others were now huge achievements for me. Things\\nthat were once simple, like choosing to get out of bed, returning phone calls,\\ngetting the knots out of my hair, wearing nice clothes, and preparing healthy\\nfood when all I wanted to do was eat baked beans out of the tin, were all now\\nmassive achievements.\\n\\nI wasn’t who I used to be anymore and if I was to become who I was on this\\nearth to be, I had to accept my feelings, not reject them, allowing them to surface\\nin order to be released forever. We all have to heal our own way. While\\nswallowing happy pills was not the path for me, though I judge no one for\\nchoosing that option, I still had to move through it in my own way. Each day was\\ndifferent. Some days were full of darkness, tears, and heartbroken sorrow. Some\\nsaw me functioning mildly, in an exhausted haze, but with determination to\\nprepare a healthy meal and freeze some, ensuring I would still be eating well on\\ndarker days. Other days, when I found the energy, I would walk over the back\\nhills and paddocks, far from sight of humans, and just breath in the sounds and\\nsights of the natural habitat.\\n\\nMeditation remained a part of daily life. I hate to imagine what I would have\\ndone without that skill. It had previously taught me that suffering is a result of\\nthe mind. The preceding years of practice had already helped to let go of an\\nenormous amount of unhealthy thinking. So it had to remain as an integral part\\nof my healing now. I wondered how anyone actually copes with this illness\\nwithout meditation. It teaches the skills to observe your thoughts and realise that\\nthey are not you. They are just your mind and while your mind is a part of you, it\\nis not all of you, nor are all of the thoughts your own. Many have originated\\n\\x0cfrom the thoughts of others projected onto you.\\n\\nThis awareness helped me enormously as I sat to meditate at least twice a day,\\nwith the intention of taking true ownership of my own thoughts and mind. It\\ntook enormous determination to focus on my practice when so much pain would\\nsurface and try to distract me. But for the majority of those hours in meditation, I\\nowned myself. By observing my thoughts while meditating but not attaching my\\nfocus to them, I returned to a place of stillness, a place of love and certainty,\\nknowing that this turmoil would surely pass one day, realising that the peaceful\\npart of me still existed within. I just had to work harder to access that at the\\nmoment, much harder. The discipline of meditation was also very good for me. It\\nmeant that despite my fluctuating moods, I had a commitment to honour daily,\\nmeaning I had to challenge myself to sit and continue my practice, regardless of\\nhow lousy I was feeling. For some people, it may be the challenge of going to\\nwork that gets them through, or continuing some other routine. For me, it was\\nmy meditation practice.\\n\\nOf course I cried too, from the very depths of my soul. Trying not to lose sight\\nof a beautiful life potentially waiting for me, if I could get myself through this\\nlevel of pain and healing, I held onto hope when I was able. When the present\\nmoment is so hindered by pain from the past, it is only hope of a different future\\nthat sometimes brings any prospective joy. So hope played a large role in my\\nhealing. In moments of semi-stillness, I dreamed of functioning again, of using\\nwhat talents I had been blessed with (as we all are), earning good money doing\\nwork I loved, laughing with friends, owing my own acreage by a fresh-water\\nriver, daring to love again, and having a child. But most, I simply dreamed of\\nknowing happiness again, of waking with joy and excitement purely for the gift\\nof being alive. I dreamed of being happy, yearning to remember what that felt\\nlike for more than a rapid, fleeting moment. Yes, I hoped for happiness.\\n\\nThe only true thing that could really be done well though was to stay as\\npresent as possible, when I could, and just continue to deal with the moment of\\nnow. Living in such a magnificent setting helped greatly, as there were so many\\nintricate things happening in the natural world around me, enabling me to\\nbecome totally absorbed in such moments, watching insects and birds, listening\\nto the breeze in the trees, watching the sky and its constant changes.\\n\\nA wonderful social worker, whose help I came to seek, was also a blessing.\\nNot only did she practice the same meditation technique as me, but in a way she\\nalso held a mirror for me to look at. Through her assistance, I came to see myself\\nfrom different angles, in kinder ways, acknowledging my own beautiful heart. I\\n\\x0calso saw how much energy I had put into looking after others and not myself, not\\nbelieving on the deepest levels that I deserved it. Much of this was due to past\\nopinions of others still affecting me on subconscious levels, people who did not\\nknow me despite thinking they did. A part of the current transformation was the\\ndetermination to break free completely from these hindrances. I had also taken\\non way too much pain from a friend who was going through a hard time herself,\\nthinking I was simply being a good friend. But in swimming out to save her, I\\nwas drowning too. I needed to separate my compassion and empathy for\\neveryone a little, by applying more detached compassion to those I empathised\\nwith.\\n\\nBeing reminded again of the need for my own compassion was significant and\\nliberating too. This brilliant social worker also helped me to see the bad habits I\\nhad previously developed in excusing other people’s behaviour, previously out\\nof wanting to keep the superficial peace and more recently out of compassion.\\nHer wonderfully direct counselling style was definitely needed, her honesty\\nworked, particularly when she asked me if I was going for a gold medal in the\\ncarer’s Olympics?\\n\\nI had too often forgotten to share some of my compassion with myself, both in\\nthought and deed. All of the previous years of growth and letting go had not\\nbeen wasted though, even if it sometimes felt this way. Instead, I had the reached\\nthe true core of my wounds, the crunch of where many of them had truly\\noriginated from, and was able to start releasing them permanently.\\n\\nAcknowledging my pain, the effects of decades of criticism from those whose\\nlove I most needed, ceasing to make excuses for unkind behaviour, and talking it\\nall out took courage, my own permission, and my willingness to step free of\\nthose patterns forever. The way to do this was by learning how to be kind to\\nmyself, also learning how to receive that kindness. I deserved goodness and\\nhappiness, completely. Even if others did not believe so, they did not know the\\npaths I had walked and it no longer mattered. I now knew I deserved amazing\\ngoodness to flow my way. It was in coming to this significant acknowledgement,\\nthat I did deserve it, which allowed me to start receiving my own kindness. I had\\nbelieved this already on other levels, but not at the depths I was now beginning\\nto operate from. That was where the refocusing was now underway, towards the\\nlevels that truly drove me. It was time to allow my own kindness in. After all, I\\ndeserved it too.\\n\\nThe old thinking patterns of low self-worth were holding on fiercely though\\nand some days it still took everything I had to be stronger than the emotional and\\n\\x0cmental pain. With each layer conquered, glimpses of beauty and euphoria started\\ncreeping in too occasionally, which was both refreshing and _ inspiring.\\nSomething as simple as the sun shining on leaves in nearby trees became so\\nincredibly beautiful, it would move me to moments of unexpected bliss. New\\nparts of myself that had been incubating for years were becoming a more natural\\npart of me now. Some permanent changes had truly happened, with some of my\\nold thinking patterns indeed being left behind properly.\\n\\nI realised that I had dealt with particular angles of my previous mental shaping\\nand had actually released them, so I acknowledged all of this with gratitude. The\\nbeauty of where I was living also continued to keep me very present. The\\nremaining pain tended to do that too of course. But the natural life unfolding\\naround the cottage nurtured me daily. As each layer of pain fell away, my senses\\nbecame more heightened and even more in tune with the natural world. This\\nencouraged me immensely, even though bad moments still lingered.\\n\\nSometimes I became angry towards myself because I wasn’t past the\\ndepression as quickly as I wanted to be. But anger directed toward anyone is just\\nfrustrated expectations. So I would let the expectation go and bring myself back\\nto the present, by acknowledging something beautiful out my window, putting\\nsome music on and singing along, or just bringing my awareness back to my\\nbreath or the sounds around me. Then I could accept my situation again,\\nknowing I was working through it all at the right pace for my own growth.\\n\\nOne of my old friends sent me a constant supply of divine, organic skin care\\nproducts. So I would then take time to carefully rub in the lotions, caring and\\nnurturing myself, both mentally and physically, to balance out previous\\nunkindness towards myself. This always left me feeling better, not to mention,\\nsmelling gorgeous. Attending to my body with such pampering reminded me of\\nhow I had nurtured my dying clients. I was now starting to give myself some of\\nthe same love I gave them.\\n\\nBut being stronger than the pain was very challenging and while good days\\nwere definitely creeping back in after some months, the depression and the\\nnegative thoughts that accompanied it seemed to then fight back with even more\\ndetermination afterwards. It certainly wasn’t willing to let go easily. After all, it\\nwas fuelled by negative patterns of self-condemnation that had ruled now for\\nmore than forty years, created by me allowing too many opinions of others into\\nmy belief system. My mind seemed to operate like an independent master and\\nthis master did not want to lose control over me.\\n\\nI was becoming my own master now though, truly realising my worth and\\n\\x0cbeauty, and consciously choosing to direct my mind into more positive belief\\nsystems. Rather than focus on old ways, I treated myself with respect and love.\\nDitties about my own goodness started to flow from me as I pottered about the\\nhome singing funny things to myself. Saying hello to my beautiful self in the\\nmirror when I’d walk past became a fun and entertaining habit too. Ensuring my\\nbody was nurtured regularly with baths and healthy food also brought me back\\nto happier moments. Little by little, happiness was returning. My old mind did\\nnot like this at all though and depression dug its ugly claws in, refusing to let go\\ncompletely. This restructuring of my thinking had already been happening for\\nyears. But now, a final dual was underway, where only one side could survive.\\n\\nIt was during this climax, this wrestle to say goodbye to my old self\\ncompletely and forever, that I eventually gave up. It just became too hard.\\nDespite the improvements to my day-to-day life and increasing moments of\\nhappiness, I was utterly exhausted emotionally. It had taken so much energy to\\nget to this point that suddenly all of my remaining strength disappeared,\\ndelivering me to the final occasion of contemplating suicide. Not one ounce of\\nstrength remained for any more mental discipline or hope. I had tried my best\\nbut was just too tired of it all. I wanted to die. I wanted this life to be over once\\nand for all.\\n\\nA friend of more than twenty years was an angel, ringing me up regularly.\\nThankfully he had his own approach. “Pick up the phone. I mean it, you’d better\\nnot be #@# killing yourself. Pick up the phone. Stop ignoring me, and pick up\\nthe #@# phone,” he would say, until I couldn’t help but pick it up, laughing\\nthrough my tears. While his approach was somewhat unorthodox, his heart is\\none of the biggest I know and humour had already helped us both through things\\nin the past. His approach worked. I needed laughter and I knew he loved me\\ndearly, as I do him. Laughter is a very underrated tool for healing.\\n\\nOn a day that he didn’t call though, I did reach the absolute bottom of\\nanywhere I had ever been in my whole life. Scrawling a farewell note, unable to\\neven write clearly, I gave up on life. It was just too hard.\\n\\nThey say that the darkest hour always comes before the dawn. This was the\\ndarkest hour of my life. I just could not live this life anymore. It was not possible\\nto ever feel any worse in myself than I did in this moment. I hated myself for the\\nweakness to not conquer my mind despite all of my efforts. I hated that I had\\ntolerated so much bullshit in my life from others. I hated that I had settled for\\nsuch a hard existence so often. I hated that it took so much courage to create the\\nlife I wanted and deserved. I hated almost everything about myself. It was\\n\\x0cindeed the darkest hour.\\n\\nAt the very instant that I finished scrawling my farewell note of apology and\\nutter sadness, the phone rang. I considered not answering it, but I did, with great\\nreluctance. It wasn’t the friend I thought it would be. It wasn’t anyone I knew.\\nInstead, what I heard was a chirpy voice from a woman saying a bright and\\nhappy hello to me. She then proceeded to offer me ambulance insurance!\\n\\n‘Great’, I thought. ‘I can’t even do suicide properly. I’ll probably need a damn\\nambulance’. I had chosen a crevice in the local region that I was going to drive\\nmy van into, ensuring I would not survive. I had given a decent amount of\\nthought to the act, as I did not want to half-do it. Fine details had been\\nconsidered in the planning.\\n\\nThe offer of ambulance insurance (which I declined through a haze) truly\\nreminded me that I may or may not succeed in my attempt. I thought about all of\\nthe lovely ambulance workers I had known over the years and realised how\\ninsensitive I had been, how consumed in my own pain I was, that I hadn’t\\nconsidered the effect my act would have on whoever found me and on those who\\nloved me. I also knew that I didn’t want a life of paralysis if I was unsuccessful,\\nparticularly self-induced paralysis. But it wasn’t just the symbolism of the\\nambulance, though of course you couldn’t ask for a better wake-up call, it was\\nthat the phone call broke the spell, the haze I was in at the very bottom of my\\npain.\\n\\nThat pivotal moment was indeed the turning point, the biggest turning point of\\nmy whole life. I didn’t want to damage the body that had provided me with so\\nmuch freedom and mobility, the beautiful, healthy body that had carried me\\nthrough everything. I didn’t want to die either. As I started to love my legs for all\\nof the miles they had already carried me, I then began to love all of me.\\n\\nIn the same minute of that phone call, I had a moment of pain in my heart\\narea. It was then I realised that my poor, tender, beautiful heart had already\\nendured enough. It couldn’t take anymore suffering or self-loathing. It needed\\nlove to heal and that love, above all else, had to come from me first.\\n\\x0cNO REGRETS\\neter\\n\\nThe speed in which things changed after this was phenomenal. Depression\\nslipped away in the night, taking its heavy cloud of darkness with it. It had only\\never been waiting for love to arrive and when that happened, it knew its role was\\ncompleted and left. I spent the next few days restoring my energy through\\nmeditation, gratitude, and reverence for my beautiful self. This nurtured my\\nheart, while soaking in the bath nurtured my body. I took long, easy walks over\\nthe hills, not pushing myself, just walking gently as I marvelled at life through\\nthe eyes of someone reborn. It was like waking up in a world so beautiful that it\\nwas difficult to remember the world before.\\n\\nTo signify the beginning of my new life I decided to carry out a formal\\nfarewell and welcoming ceremony. I collected wood from the paddocks and lit a\\nbeautiful fire. There were things that needed a proper farewell from my life,\\naspects of my old self and the circumstances that had risen from that. So I wrote\\nthese things down as well as things being welcomed. Then as the sun went down\\nand the first evening stars came out, I happily stood by the healing, warming\\nfire. Old parts of myself were thanked and given farewell as I then dropped that\\npiece of paper into the fire. Each welcome was also acknowledged. Sitting out\\nunder that country sky after, staring into the fire, I felt immense love for myself\\nand for life. I also felt incredible gratitude.\\n\\nThe firelight continued to burn warmly. Grinning, I looked at the vast cover of\\nstars above me and acknowledged that through all of this, someone new had\\nindeed been born. The person I had been working towards being for years was\\nnow who I was. She had finally been allowed through. The person who had\\nmade too many excuses for others, had carried decades of pain, and who hadn’t\\naccepted that she too deserved every happiness was no longer needed. Her role\\nwas now complete. She was gently thanked for her part in my evolution, and was\\nnow gone.\\n\\nEvery day following continued to reveal delight on fresh levels. It was almost\\nlike discovering life for the first time. Never had I felt so free. Happiness, as I\\nhad never known happiness before, completely unhindered, joyous, and guilt-\\nfree, became my more natural state. New birds came to sit on the fence and sing\\n\\x0cto me. Old ones followed me when I walked the paddocks in a state of bliss. All\\nof my senses became more heightened, feeling like I had just finished weeks of\\nsilent meditation, except that this more alert state remained. Natural sounds were\\nclearer, and colours brighter and more alive. I noticed as least thirty different\\nshades of green in the country surrounding the cottage.\\n\\nThere was space and clarity within that I had always believed was there, but\\nhad never quite known. My past was now of little relevance either. The wisdom\\ngained along the way was a part of me. The past has served as an incredible\\nlearning tool and none of the learning had been wasted. But the suffering that\\nhad come to shape me had played its role and had now disintegrated. There was\\nnothing to prove, nothing to explain, nothing to justify. My face ached from\\nsmiling. Almost overnight, life shifted onto a completely different plane. Living\\npresently had also now become a way of life, after years of practice.\\n\\nThe doors of opportunity then swung open. All of the past efforts on my\\ncreative journey, of focus, resilience and sacrifices, started to be rewarded. My\\nwork gained huge momentum and new writing opportunities arrived from\\nunimagined sources. Love for myself had opened the doors, allowing great\\nthings to flow my way. It had all been waiting patiently for years, simply for my\\nown readiness.\\n\\nAs time has since unfolded, the natural flow of goodness continues to grow.\\nNew support systems too have built themselves around me, both professionally\\nand personally. Of course, there will always be new things to learn about myself\\nbut I never take even the tiniest blessing for granted now.\\n\\nOver the previous years I had been consciously creating the life I imagined, by\\nreleasing my hindrances one layer at a time. Getting very clear about the life I\\nwanted to be living and the person I wanted to be, was also a necessary part of\\nthis process. If occasional blockages now surface, I am patient and loving with\\nmyself whilst working through them. Self-discovery is a joyful process and I can\\nsmile at my humanness.\\n\\nWith all that happened, I found myself feeling closer than ever to every one of\\nthe beautiful people I had cared for in their passing. This new life unravelling for\\nme was the kind of life they had each glimpsed as having once been possible,\\nwhen they had looked back and spoken of their regrets. In their final weeks and\\ndays, when all else had fallen away, they could see what potential joy life had\\noffered them, if only they had lived differently.\\n\\nNot every person spoke of regrets though. Some people said they would have\\ndone some things differently, but were not consumed with any actual regret.\\n\\x0cSome were beautifully content with the life they had led. Or in the least,\\nbeautifully accepting of the life they had led. Many others did have regrets\\nthough and had a strong desire to be heard, to have their thoughts known. The\\nlength of time I spent with each client was possibly a catalyst for the honesty\\nthat each relationship came to know. For those large amounts of time, I will\\nalways be very grateful.\\n\\nThe regrets they shared left me determined to not feel the same at the end of\\nmy own time, whenever that was. There was no way I was going to be given the\\ngift of this wisdom and not learn by it. But having now endured the biggest tests,\\nI understood just how difficult the challenges could be. I also now understood\\nthough, how joyous the rewards were by making it through.\\n\\nThe potential of fulfillment and pleasure, that each of these dear people caught\\na glimpse of towards their passing, is what is on offer to every one of us now,\\nbefore our own time to pass arrives. Each new day that unfolds leaves me even\\nmore enchanted with the natural flow of goodness. It wants to come through and\\nit does so when you learn how to allow it, through faith and self-love. It awaits\\neveryone. You just need to get out of your own way first and that is where the\\nreal work is — learning to own your own thoughts by clearing away the debris\\nthat stops you from letting it all flow.\\n\\nLearning will always continue. It’s not like you’ll reach a stage of growth and\\nsay, “Great. Now I can sit back, know everything, and cruise through every day\\nwithout ever having to learn another thing”. Even Stella, who had done so much\\nwork on her inner journey, was reminded of the need to let go and surrender at\\ntimes. In doing so, she was able to become more peaceful in her remaining days,\\nbefore leaving with a radiant smile on her face when the time to pass over\\narrived.\\n\\nSo if the learning never stops, we may as well embrace it rather than resist it.\\nNot one day goes by that I don’t learn something new about myself. But I can do\\nso now with loving kindness, by loving myself in an unconditional way, with no\\nself-judgment. Laughing gently and lovingly also allows the growth process to\\nbe smoother.\\n\\nWhen Grace spoke the words, “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to\\nmyself, not the life others expected of me,” she carried such sadness about her\\nlife turning out the way it did.\\n\\nIt is a pity that being who you truly are requires so much courage. But it does.\\nIt takes enormous courage at times. Being who you are, whoever that is,\\nsometimes cannot even be articulated at first, not even to yourself. All you know\\n\\x0cis there is a yearning within that is not being fulfilled by the life you are\\ncurrently living. Having to explain this to others, who have not walked in your\\nshoes, may just leave you questioning yourself even further.\\n\\nBut as the wise man Buddha said more than two millennia ago, “The mind\\nknows no answers. The heart knows no questions”. It is the heart that guides you\\nto joy, not the mind. Overcoming the mind and letting go of other’s expectations\\nallows you to hear your own heart. Having the courage to then follow it is where\\ntrue happiness lies. In the meantime, keep on cultivating the heart while\\nmastering the mind. As the heart grows, life brings more joy and peace your\\nway. A happy life wants you as much as you want it.\\n\\nWhen Anthony lay is the nursing home and admitted to not having the courage\\nto try for a better life, he sadly showed the consequences of being ruled by such\\nfear. It doesn’t mean that you too will end up in a nursing home before your\\ntime. But the lack of both stimulus and happiness that became a part of his life\\nare no different to the lives of millions amongst us. Each day was just a mind\\nnumbing routine, safe and secure, but never satisfying.\\n\\nIt takes fortitude to create big changes. The longer you stay in the wrong\\nenvironment and remain its product though, the longer you deny yourself the\\nopportunity to know true happiness and satisfaction. Life is too short to watch it\\ngo by, just because of fear that can be conquered if faced.\\n\\nLike the vines trapping beautiful flowers in the garden of Florence’s mansion,\\nwe are all capable of creating our own trappings. Obviously, many of these are\\nnot quite so easy to remove as her vine was. Most trappings have the strength of\\ndecades of growth behind them and do not take kindly to being removed. They\\nwill hang on for dear life, strangling your beauty if you let them.\\n\\nJust as they were created over time though, they can be undone over time too.\\nIt is a delicate process of determination, bravery and at times, of letting go. It is\\nhaving the courage to stop unhealthy relationships in their tracks and say\\n“Enough”. It is treating yourself with respect and kindness, both of which you\\ndeserve. Mostly though, to break free of your own trappings, it is about\\nbecoming an observer of your own thoughts and habits. This awareness helps\\nsolutions become more apparent.\\n\\nLife is your own, not someone else’s. If you are not finding some element of\\nhappiness in what you have created and are doing nothing to improve on it, then\\nthe gift of every new day is wasted. A tiny step or a small decision are great\\nstarting points, those and taking responsibility for your own happiness. A happy\\nlife can also be found without moving house or doing anything drastic in your\\n\\x0cphysical world. It is about changing your perception and being brave enough to\\nhonour some of your own desires too. No one else can make you happy or\\nunhappy, unless you allow him or her to.\\n\\nYes, having the courage to be yourself and not who others expect you to be\\nmay take a lot of strength and honesty. But so does lying on your deathbed and\\nadmitting that you wished you had done it differently. There were many other\\nclients in between those mentioned. This regret, wishing they had been true to\\nthemselves, was the most common one of all.\\n\\nWhen John said he wished he hadn’t worked so hard, he was also speaking\\nsome of the most common words I would hear throughout those years. During\\nhis final weeks, sitting out on the balcony watching life on the harbour unfold,\\nJohn was burdened with regret. There is nothing at all wrong in loving the work\\nyou do. In fact, this is how it should be. But it’s about finding balance so that\\nwork is not your whole life. I can still hear that dear man sighing deeply, as he\\ncame to terms with the choices he had made.\\n\\nListening then to Charlie’s insistence on the benefits of a simple life, I had to\\nagree with his wisdom and life experience. True value is not on what you own,\\nbut on who you are. Dying people know this. Their belongings are of no\\nconsequence whatsoever at the end. What other people think of them, or what\\nthey have achieved in belongings, does not even enter their thinking at such a\\ntime.\\n\\nIn the end, what matters to people is how much happiness they have brought to\\nthose they love and how much time they spent doing things they themselves\\nloved. Trying to ensure that those they left behind don’t end up with the same\\nregrets also became critical for many people. None of the life reviews I\\nwitnessed from their deathbeds were spent on thoughts of wishing they had\\nbought or owned more, not even one. Instead, what most occupies the thoughts\\nof dying people are how they lived their lives, what they did, and if they had\\nmade a positive difference to those they left behind, whether that was family,\\ncommunity or whoever.\\n\\nThe things you often think you need are sometimes the things that keep you\\ntrapped in an unfulfilled life. Simplicity is the key to changing this, that and\\nletting go of the need for validation through ownership or through other’s\\nexpectations of you. Taking risks also requires courage. But you cannot control\\neverything. Staying in a seemingly secure environment does not guarantee that\\nlife’s lessons will pass you by unnoticed. They can still come out of the blue,\\nwhen you least expect them. So can life’s rewards though, for those with courage\\n\\x0cto honour their hearts. The clock ticks for every one of us. It is your own choice\\nhow you spend your remaining days.\\n\\nAs Pearl understood, things flow when you need them. She believed that the\\nmost important thing is to work towards finding your purpose, to do your work,\\nwhatever it is, with the right intention and not get trapped into unhappy work\\nsituations by a fear of lack. It is about learning and daring to think without\\nlimitations and not trying to control how things will flow to you. Life is over so\\nquickly, she said. It is. Some of us will live a long life, many of us won’t. But if\\nyou can know happiness and fulfillment in this brief time, there is no need for\\nregret when the end comes, as it inevitably will.\\n\\nLearning how to express feelings is unfortunately a challenge for too many\\nadults. It was also a deep frustration and regret for dying people, including\\nJozsef. He wanted to express himself but didn’t know how, as he’d had no\\npractice. The heartache this brought to the lovely man was his greatest regret, as\\nhe died feeling like his family had never truly known him. Other clients\\ndeveloped illnesses associated with the bitterness they carried, as they had also\\nnever learned to express themselves.\\n\\nLike anything, you get better with practice. So by starting with small acts of\\nbravery in expressing yourself, you become more at ease with opening up and\\neven begin to enjoy sharing such honesty. You’ll never be able to control the\\nreactions of others. However, although people may initially react when you\\nchange the way you are by speaking honestly, in the end it raises the relationship\\nto a whole new and healthier level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy\\nrelationship from your life completely. Whichever way, you win.\\n\\nWe can never know how long we are here for or how long those we love will\\nbe. So rather than have to live with the regrets before your dying time, ensure\\nthose you value know how you feel now. As dear Jude said, guilt is a toxic\\nemotion to accompany your remaining years. Expressing your feelings feels\\ngood too, when you get used to it. It is just the fear of how it will be received\\nthat holds you back. So knock the fear on the head and dare to reveal your\\nbeautiful self to others, before it is too late either way.\\n\\nIf you are already carrying guilt from things left unsaid to someone already\\npassed, it is now time to forgive yourself. You are not honouring your life by\\ncarrying guilt forward. It is time to be gentle with yourself. That was who you\\nwere then. It does not need to be who you are now. Compassion for who you\\nused to be, given from who you are now is the first seed of kindness towards\\nself-forgiveness.\\n\\x0cIf people in your life don’t appear to respond to your honest expression, it\\ndoesn’t mean they haven’t heard you or that you should not have expressed\\nyourself. Nanci with Alzheimer’s disease was a great example of this. Other\\nrelationships in my life though have also been transformed through consistency\\nof kindness and honesty. For a long time, it appeared that my words were not\\nheard. But when the other people were ready to express their feelings, it was\\nobvious that every word had been heard along the way. It wouldn’t have\\nmattered in the end though. I was peaceful knowing I’d had the courage to\\nexpress myself honestly. If any of us had been taken unexpectedly, I would have\\nbeen without guilt. There was no one taken for granted, no one who didn’t know\\nthat I loved them, even if they were not able to express themselves in return so\\nhonestly. Tell people how you feel. Life is short.\\n\\nLocating her friend for Doris brought me true enjoyment and fulfillment.\\nWhen she spoke of regretting not staying in touch with her friends, I had no idea\\nhow often I would also hear this regret through other clients to follow. Now\\nhaving been through what I have and knowing how valuable old and loyal\\nfriends were in carrying me through, it is even less difficult to understand this\\nregret. Most people have friends but when it comes to the crunch, there are not a\\nlot of friends who can be there through the absolute hardest times. When\\nsomeone is dying, this is one such time.\\n\\nHistory and understanding are what friendships offer. As the clients were\\nlooking back over their lives, it was often friends they missed to reminisce with.\\nLife gets busy and friendships fade away. There will always be people who come\\nand go in life, friends included. But those who truly matter, those who you love\\nmost dearly, are worth every ounce of effort to stay in touch with. They are the\\nones who will be there for you when you most need them, just as you will be\\nthere for them. Sometimes it is not possible to physically be there, but even\\nphone contact gives people a lot of strength and comfort during hard times.\\n\\nAcceptance and forgiveness from friends, particularly when dying, assisted\\nElizabeth in finding her peace after years of alcoholism. In the end, it is just\\nabout love and relationships. But not everyone was so lucky to track down\\nfriends at the end, despite the desire to. That’s why not losing touch in the first\\nplace is important. No one knows what lies ahead or when the time will come\\nthat you are longing for your friends and in between, you still have the gift of\\nthem in your life.\\n\\nWatching the roster of Harry’s support team only continued to emphasise the\\nimportance of this at the end. While it can be a gloomy time of sadness for\\n\\x0cothers, the person actually dying wants to enjoy their remaining time as much as\\npossible. Friends bring humour to sad times and this humour brings happiness to\\nthe dying person. Whether you are dying or not, friends are the ones capable of\\nmaking you laugh through the worst of times.\\n\\nSitting beside me on her bed after she had screamed at me to go, Rosemary’s\\nadmission to having never allowed herself to be happy was an honest one. It also\\nimproved her remaining time immensely. Rosemary hadn’t believed that she\\ndeserved happiness, due to not being what her family had expected her to be.\\nWhen she realised it was a choice, she learned to allow happiness through and\\nwas able to find a part of herself that had been dormant for most of her adult life.\\nIt was a beautiful smile that sometimes then came to escape her in her last\\nweeks.\\n\\nAppreciating every single step along the way is one of the keys to such\\nhappiness. As Cath contemplated her final time she spoke of missing a lot of\\npotential happiness by focusing too much on the results, rather than on the time\\nalong the way as well. It is so easy to think that happiness depends on something\\nfalling into place, when it is the other way around. Things fall into place when\\nhappiness is already found.\\n\\nWhile it may not be possible to be happy every day, learning to steer the mind\\ntowards that direction is still possible. Acknowledging something beautiful\\noutside of the sadness is one example, something that helped me to move back\\ntowards a place of peace myself. The mind may cause great suffering. But it can\\nalso be used to create a beautiful life, once mastered and used properly. Every\\nsingle of us has reasons to feel sorry for ourselves. Every one of us has suffered.\\nBut life doesn’t owe us anything. We only owe ourselves, to make the most of\\nthe life we are living, of the time we have left, and to live in gratitude.\\n\\nWhen we accept that there will always be learning and that some of this will\\nbring suffering and some will bring happiness, we reach a place of better\\nequanimity. From this perspective, happiness becomes a more conscious choice\\nand the waves are no longer so tumultuous. Some that may have once left you\\ncrushed and wounded may now be ridden with the skills that come from\\nexperience and wisdom.\\n\\nIt is also perfectly OK to be silly and playful sometimes. You just have to give\\nyourself permission. It is also more than possible to have fun without drugs or\\nalcohol. There is no rule in place that says adults have to be serious and cannot\\nhave silly fun. Taking life too critically or being concerned how you will appear\\nto others, are going to be regrets you face at the end of your life, if you let such\\n\\x0cthoughts hinder your happiness now.\\n\\nOf course, your perspective makes a huge difference to happiness, as beautiful\\nLenny showed. Despite the losses in his life, he focused on the gifts he had\\nreceived and saw his life as a good one. The same view you look at every day,\\nthe same life, can become something brand new by focusing on its gifts rather\\nthan the negative aspects. Perspective is your own choice and the best way to\\nshift that perspective is through gratitude, by acknowledging and appreciating\\nthe positives.\\n\\nDespite the many regrets dying people shared with me, in the very end, each\\nof them found their peace. Some were not able to forgive themselves until their\\nlast couple of days but they did manage it before they passed. Many experienced\\na variety of emotions leading up to this, including denial, fear, anger, remorse,\\nand the worst, self-condemnation. Many also experienced positive feelings\\nthough, of love and immense joy for memories that surfaced as they lived\\nthrough their final weeks.\\n\\nBefore the very end though, they found a peaceful acceptance that their time\\nhad come and they were able to forgive themselves for the regrets they\\nexpressed, regardless of how tormented they had been. It was imperative to\\nmany of these clients however, that others learned through their regrets.\\n\\nThey were all people who had been given the time to contemplate their lives.\\nThose who go suddenly do not have such a luxury, and many of us will be\\namongst those too. It is so important to consider the life you are living now, as\\nthere may be little time given at your passing to find your peace or for any\\ncontemplation. Instead, you will die knowing that you have spent your whole life\\nchasing happiness through the wrong channels; with it always eluding you,\\nalways just out of your grasp, always depending on the right things or situations\\nto come your way. You will die knowing that the opportunity to change your\\ndirection well before it was too late just slipped on by.\\n\\nThe peace each of these dear people found before their passing is available\\nnow, without having to wait until your final hours. You have the choice to\\nchange your life, to be courageous and to live a life true to your heart, one that\\nwill see you pass without regret.\\n\\nKindness and forgiveness are a great starting point. Not just to others, but to\\nyourself as well. Forgiving yourself is also such a necessary component for this\\nprocess. Without it, you continue to add fertiliser to the existing bad seeds in\\nyour mind by being hard on yourself, as I once did too. But self-forgiveness and\\nkindness weakens the strength of these seeds. Healthier ones replace them and\\n\\x0cgrow stronger, in time overshadowing the old seeds until there is nothing left to\\nsustain their growth.\\n\\nThe bravery needed to change your life is easier to find when you are kind on\\nyourself. Good things take time too, so patience is also required. Every single\\none of us is an amazing person with a potential limited only by our own\\nthinking. We are all amazing. When you think of the numerous environmental\\nand genetic influences that have shaped you, including the genes that have come\\nto you through your own unique biology, it makes you a pretty amazing and\\nspecial person. All of your life experiences so far, both good and bad, also\\ncontribute to you being unlike any other person on this planet. You are already\\nspecial. You are already unique.\\n\\nIt is time to realise your own worth and to realise the worth of others. Lay\\nyour judgments down. Be kind on yourself and be kind on others. As no one has\\never truly walked in another’s shoes, seen through another’s eyes, or felt through\\nanother’s heart for their whole life, no one knows just how much each other has\\nsuffered either. A little bit of empathy goes a long way.\\n\\nBy being kind to others and tossing your judgment out the window, you are\\nbeing kind to yourself too by planting better seeds. Forgive yourself for blaming\\nothers for your unhappiness. Learn to be gentle on yourself, accepting your own\\nhumanness and frailty. Forgive others too who have blamed you for their\\nunhappiness. We are all human. We have all said and done things that could have\\nbeen otherwise done in a kinder way.\\n\\nLife is over so quickly. It is possible to reach the end with no regrets. It takes\\nsome bravery to live it right, to honour the life you are here to live but the choice\\nis yours. So will be the rewards. Appreciate the time you have left by valuing all\\nof the gifts in your life and that includes especially, your own, amazing self.\\n\\x0cSMILE AND KNOW\\neter\\n\\nWhen I look at my life now, there are moments that still blow me away. The life\\nI imagined becomes more reality every day. The person I had imagined is now\\nme. It came about through courage, resilience, discipline, and through learning\\nto love my own heart. Life can actually be easy and joyous. It can in fact flow\\nwell. Even better is that as I have continued to adjust and grow, continuing to\\naccept that I deserve all that comes my way, the more easily things keep flowing.\\n\\nOne little phrase kept my faith strong through that final, dark period: Smile\\nand Know. On one particularly hard day, my old thinking was holding on for\\ndear life and telling me I didn’t deserve all I had dreamed of. My new thinking\\nmeanwhile was trying to move in permanently, reassuring me I did. So I prayed\\nfor some very simple and clear guidance, something that would not be hard to\\nremember in my tearful state, in order to conquer the hard days. I needed\\nsomething to keep me strong and with hope whenever I was able. The words\\nSmile and Know came to me.\\n\\nI wrote these words down and put them in obvious places around the home.\\nWhenever I walked past them, a commitment with myself was honoured and I\\nwould Smile and Know that this time would pass and good would follow. It is\\nalso much easier to be strong in faith when you are smiling. So it would\\nautomatically lift my mood and reassure me that I would indeed find more\\nreasons to smile again. There was no point reading the words without actually\\nsmiling though, as the smiling itself allowed the knowing to be easier. So smile I\\ndid.\\n\\nLater, I added underneath Thank and Know, ensuring prayers of gratitude were\\nsaid in advance, with confidence and faith that it was all coming to me. Smile\\nand Know, Thank and Know, became my mantra as I went about my days\\nsmiling and knowing when I could. As I did so, I was walking in complete faith,\\nwhich left me naturally wanting to thank as well. My prayers, dreams and\\nintentions had already been heard. My only job was to Smile and Know and to\\nThank and Know. Naturally this enabled me to smile much more than I would\\nhave otherwise.\\n\\nOf course, there were times when I was not strong enough to draw on these\\n\\x0cwords, including that final day of utter sadness and resignation. But that time of\\nsurrender was the ultimate turning point. It was true I could not live with the\\npain of my past anymore and I was right in a sense. It was the end of my life, as I\\nknew it at least. But I didn’t have to die physically. Only that old part of myself\\ndied, spiritually. Those old ideas of myself could not survive the bright light of\\nmy own love. The new life that had been quietly manifesting for years was\\nfinally able to be born.\\n\\nWhile I was smiling and knowing, my dreams felt real and became even more\\na part of me. That’s why the doors of opportunity swung open when I was finally\\nable to realise my own worth. The dreams had already arrived and were simply\\nwaiting for me to let them come through. So it was with a joyous heart that I\\nopened up, allowing things to flow. They did in many and various forms:\\npersonally and professionally.\\n\\nSome time later as I sat in delighted shock at the suggestion of my dear,\\nbeautiful parents to have a vegan Christmas, I smiled wholeheartedly, having just\\nbeen given the best Christmas present in the world. For more than two decades I\\nhad dreamed of at least a vegetarian Christmas. When it finally came about, it\\ndid so with such natural ease that we all agreed it was one of the most beautiful\\nChristmas days we’d ever experienced. With my mum chopping vegetables\\nbeside me, sharing cheek and laughter, my dad sorted out the music. Country\\ntunes from the 1950’s floated through the home as we all laughed, chatted, and\\nprepared a great feast. It was joyous and easy.\\n\\nMy work continues to grow and thrive, bringing satisfaction and enjoyment.\\nWhile it is possible to find work you love in being employed by others, in the\\ntimes we live in, the best way forward for me is to work for myself. That is what\\nI needed and wanted most anyway, to live life my way, including my work-life.\\nHigh levels of motivation and amazing clarity accompanied me onto my new\\nplane of existence, along with the best from the old life, including self-\\ndiscipline.\\n\\nMaking contacts in the local area, meetings were set up all over the place.\\nInspiration and ideas poured forth. Excitement built as I re-entered the world,\\ncreating new and positive opportunities for myself. Through a couple of\\ncommunity groups, I taught some songwriting workshops to disadvantaged\\nsectors of society. Teaching again, and being my own boss, was lovely and of\\ncourse, watching the transformation of the people in the classes was hugely\\nrewarding.\\n\\nAfter the seriousness of my past, it was time for more joy in my work as well.\\n\\x0cSo I created a children’s show, performing to children under five years old.\\nWatching these delightful, uninhibited, little humans dancing and jumping\\naround to my new songs has been delightful. Writing opportunities also flowed,\\nas did a new album’s worth of adult songs. It amazes me of what we are truly\\ncapable of creatively and physically when we let go of all that has held us back.\\n\\nMy blog experienced further massive waves, bringing more people to my\\nwork. I also created a happy and positive range of T-shirts, bumper stickers, and\\ntote bags, drawing on lines from my songs and articles. Not only did the ideas\\nflow forth, but motivated action also accompanied.\\n\\nAs I now share my autumn nights snuggled up with a beautiful man, I smile at\\nhow much life can change. He is a dear person. There were things we both had\\nto let go of, before we could find each other but timing is an amazing thing. Life\\nis now lived from new perspectives.\\n\\nIn the very best of ways I have been reminded about the cycles of life. Death\\nhas certainly been shown to me directly through others. I have known my own\\nkind of death too now though, by watching that old part of me finally cease to\\nexist. It was a spiritual death, a death of a part of me that had controlled me for\\ndecades. It was also the birth of a new spirit, one that I had always suspected was\\nthere, one that I wished to be. It was a painful death, yet it was what truly freed\\nme from the conditioning of my past, of unnecessary burdens, of all that held me\\nback.\\n\\nWith the real me now allowed to live unhindered, I continue to evolve into\\nwho I really am. It is only through shedding what I have that I am able to\\nactually know who that is and I love her. I love her courage. I love her heart. I\\nlove her creativity. I love her mind. I love her body. I love her kindness. I love all\\nof her.\\n\\nLife moves in new directions. It is a new beginning, a new birth of myself. In\\nthe best possible way I have also been reminded of other new beginnings. A\\nprecious baby now grows within me. I have been blessed with the opportunity to\\nbecome a mother. As my womb expands and my body swells in the divinity of\\nwomanhood, I am in bliss and overwhelming gratitude to know such an\\nexperience. It is a world away from the life I once knew — the isolation, the\\nsadness, the hopelessness. Yet again, I am reminded of just how much we can fit\\ninto one lifetime. Thank goodness I did not end my life when I thought to. Thank\\ngoodness.\\n\\nThe bond between mother and child grows daily. I have also been blessed with\\ngreat health throughout, much to the curse of other poor pregnant women\\n\\x0csuffering morning sickness. I absolutely love being pregnant and soon will be\\nguiding another soul through their human journey until they are old enough to\\nfly in directions of their own choice. Life may certainly have its share of death\\nand endings but it has its share of birth and beginnings too. I am grateful to have\\nbeen exposed to both, literally and symbolically, on so many occasions.\\n\\nWhenever out on a leap of faith, things have never turned out as I had\\nimagined, but in the long run, things have always tumed out better. Faith is a\\npowerful force and one that creates incredible blessings. Letting go of limitations\\nand of trying to control how things will flow is an immense gift to one’s self.\\n\\nStrangely one of the hardest things for many, as it was for me, is to learn how\\nto receive, to realise you deserve it, then allow the goodness to flow. Most of the\\nmiraculous solutions that have flowed to me throughout my life have also come\\nvia other people. We are all much more inter-connected than we acknowledge,\\nand play bigger roles in each other’s lives than we know.\\n\\nSo learning to receive is a necessity if you are truly open to seeing your\\ndreams realised. As any person who is a natural giver knows, there is great\\npleasure in giving. But if you are a giver without allowing yourself to also\\nreceive, then not only are you blocking the natural flow of things to you and\\ncreating an imbalance, you are robbing someone else of the pleasure of giving.\\nSo allow others to give too. It is only pride or lack of self-worth that stops\\nanyone from being able to receive and every single one of us deserves such\\ngoodness.\\n\\nIf you are one who does not know how to actually give, then keep practicing.\\nJust try it without expectation. It feels good. Just give for the pleasure of giving.\\nTo do so with accountability is not true giving though, nor is giving then\\nreminding people of it later in anger. Waiting for the good to flow back to you\\nafter giving is not it in its truest sense either. But giving with the sole intention of\\ngiving, whether that is in love, kindness, or action is where true pleasure comes\\nin. And yes, those who give with this intention are rewarded, but not always\\nimmediately and not necessarily in ways you imagine. But you also need to\\nknow how to receive too, allowing the flow to go both ways. Of course, this\\nincludes giving and receiving with your own self too.\\n\\nIt is possible to change the world and us. As we improve our own lives, and\\nwork toward having no regrets, we naturally improve the lives of all around us.\\nIt is possible to reverse the segregation and disharmony we have created in\\nsociety. It is possible to be happy. It is possible to work towards dying without\\nregrets while still alive and well.\\n\\x0cWe are all fragile in our own way, like globes of delicate glass. Imagine the\\nold light bulb with the roundish glass surrounding the globe. (It doesn’t quite\\ncreate the same image if you imagine the new energy-saving tube-like light\\nglobes, though either will suffice). A part of all of us is like a delicate light\\nglobe. A beautiful light shines from within, one that can remove darkness from\\nany place. When we are bor, we are shining bright, bringing great light and\\nhappiness to all. People marvel at our beauty and light.\\n\\nThen over time, muck starts being thrown at us. This muck is not about us. It\\nis theirs, the people who are throwing it. But they hurl it at us anyway. After a\\nwhile, it is not only those close to us who throw muck on us. It is school friends,\\nworkmates, society, and many of whom we come across. It affects us all\\ndifferently, some become victims, some bullies, some take it in and it stays\\nwithin for a long time, some appear to let it go naturally. Regardless of how it\\nappears to affect each of us, it still hinders our original light and goodness from\\nshining at its absolute best.\\n\\nWith so many people throwing muck on us, we figure that they must be right.\\nSo we join in, throwing muck on ourselves too. Why not? All of the muck\\nthrowers can’t be wrong after all. If Iam going to throw muck on myself, then it\\nmust be normal and OK to throw muck on others too. Yes, I’ll throw some more\\nand I’ll continue to let others throw it on me. Eventually, you are carrying so\\nmuch muck that not only are you weighed down by it, but also your light cannot\\nbe seen at all anymore. Every inch of you is covered in muck, a lot of it from\\nwhat others have thrown and some from when you joined in and started\\nthrowing it on yourself too.\\n\\nThen one day you remember there was once a beautiful light shining in you.\\nBut things have been dark for so long, you hardly remember that part of\\nyourself. It can still be felt sometimes though, when you are quiet and alone. The\\nwarm glow has remained shining all this time, regardless of the darkness\\nsurrounding it. You realise that you want to shine again. You want to remember\\nwho you are when you’re not carrying other people’s muck on you, or your own.\\n\\nSo you start saying you’ve had enough. You stop allowing anyone else to\\nthrow muck on you. People don’t like this. But you are determined and move out\\nof reach of the muck throwers. Slowly you start rubbing very gently to remove\\nsome of it off you. But it has to be done very tenderly, as you are incredibly\\nfragile underneath. If you try to do it too roughly or hurriedly, you will shatter\\nand never know your light again.\\n\\nSo you slowly and patiently work away at cleaning it off. A tiny ray of light\\n\\x0cbreaks through and you are given a glimpse of your own beauty again. It feels\\ngood. Then someone throws some more muck at you and you have to start\\nremoving it again. So you wipe that bit off and clean some more away.\\nFrightened by what you see though, you then throw some at yourself. You don’t\\ndeserve to shine this brightly. Here have some more muck. But the light has\\ncaught a glimpse of the outside again and starts to shine brighter. It wants to be\\nseen.\\n\\nWith each bit of light that starts shining out, you start feeling better. It gives\\nyou a taste of how great it would feel to be free of all that you are carrying. This\\nmakes you recognise just how much everyone else is also carrying and you feel\\ncompassion. You decide that from now on you are not going to throw any more\\nmuck on others. After all, how can we all be shining at our best if we keep\\nthrowing it all over place and on each other? So you get back to work on\\nyourself and very gently rub a little more off. It takes a lot of patience and\\ngentleness, working on a little bit at a time. But excitement builds each time\\nanother pocket of light breaks through and you catch another glimpse of your\\nown beauty and radiance.\\n\\nAt times you are tempted to throw some more back on yourself or others, as\\nyou have been in the habit of it for almost all of your life. But now you see how\\nthe little bits of light shining out of you are helping others, who are also\\nbecoming more courageous. They start cleaning off some of their own muck.\\nThey have to be very gentle too, as everyone is delicate and fragile underneath\\nand can shatter very easily. You also want to help others clean theirs off. But\\nthey have to do it themselves, as no one but them knows just how fragile they\\nare underneath.\\n\\nYou can show others how you did it and maybe that will help them. But they\\nhave to do the work themselves, at their own pace, and in their own way. And of\\ncourse, not everyone has the courage or strength to do it all at once. So you are\\npatient, respectful, and compassionate, as you now understand that it can\\nsometimes be a very painful and frightening experience.\\n\\nYou feel good in yourself. It is a new feeling but you like it a lot. So you give\\nup throwing muck on yourself forever, because you are beginning to love the\\nbeauty you have discovered, as your light continues to shine brighter. There are\\nrays of light coming out of you at all angles now. But some of the oldest muck is\\nstill very stuck on you, making it the hardest to remove. It had grown very\\ncomfy here over the decades, thank you very much. It doesn’t want to go\\nanywhere. The closer you are to the glass, the more delicately you have to rub.\\n\\x0cYet the more stubborm and determined the muck is at this level.\\n\\nIt has been such a big job and you are very weary. You are already an\\nimprovement on who you were, definitely. Maybe this will be enough. Maybe I\\ncan live with this last layer of muck and just shine as much as I am now. But the\\nlight is strong and determined too. It wants you to shine at your brightest. So it\\ngives you even more strength and you keep cleaning away the last of it.\\n\\nFinally, you have done it and your brightness astonishes everyone, especially\\nyourself. You had no idea you could be so beautiful and shine with such\\nradiance. Now when you hang out with other light globes, they too want to shine\\nbrightly as they can see your beauty and it reminds them that they too have such\\npotential inside of them. They had just forgotten it with all of the muck they\\nwere also carrying.\\n\\nSome light globes think it is too hard to let their light show, so they stick\\ntogether in the darkness, trying to convince themselves and each other that they\\nare happy this way. Who needs all that hard work when we have become used to\\ncarrying our muck? Why, I like it this way, they say and I am going to throw\\nsome more muck around. I am going out there right now to throw some on those\\nbright lights that are happy and having a good time out there. How dare they\\nhave so much enjoyment?\\n\\nSo the dark globes head outside with all of the muck they can find and start\\nthrowing it. They work better in a team too, safety in numbers and all that. They\\ncan’t see as clearly anymore though, as everything is so bright with all of this\\ncleaning going on. But they spot a few light globes that are now shining brightly\\nand happily, as they have almost finished removing their muck. So the dark\\nglobes throw heaps of it at those bright ones. It doesn’t stick though. What’s\\ngoing on? It used to always stick.\\n\\nWhat they didn’t know was that even though the light was hidden for all of\\nthese years, it had still been growing inside. Now it shines so warmly and\\nbrightly that the muck will never stick again. It just slides off, without even\\nleaving a mark or an impression anymore.\\n\\nYour own glow is like that. You have a light within you that is beautiful and\\npotentially radiant. But you need patience and tenderness with yourself to\\nremove all of the muck you have been carrying for decades. As each little bit is\\nremoved, a little more of your true self will shine through.\\n\\nEach of the regrets shared from the bedsides of those now dearly departed\\npeople, takes courage and love to conquer. But the choice is yours. Like a light\\nthat wants to shine brightly and cheerfully, you have a guidance within that will\\n\\x0clead you through, one step at a time.\\n\\nBe who you are, find balance, speak honestly, value those you love, and allow\\nyourself to be happy. If you do this, then you will not only be honouring\\nyourself, but all of those who despaired in their final weeks, by not having had\\nthe courage to do so previously in their own lives. The choice is yours. Your life\\nis your own.\\n\\nWhen the challenges are thrown your way and you are wondering how on\\nEarth it will all come together, how you will find peace about a particular\\nrelationship, when the contacts you need will arrive, or how you will find the\\nmoney to make something happen, just remember that what your heart wants,\\nwants you too. You just have to get out of the way sometimes. Take what action\\nyou can and then let go. Get out of your own way.\\n\\nThen when you find yourself in this position, stand tall, put your shoulders\\nback, and take a deep and loving breath. Walk on being proud of who you\\nalready are, with full faith and confidence you deserve it, that your prayers have\\nbeen heard, and that they are already on their way to you. And simply remember\\none little phrase. Smile and know. Just smile and know.\\n\\n\""
